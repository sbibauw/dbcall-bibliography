# Dialogue Systems and Bots for Language Learning — a bibliography

This repository aims to maintain collaboratively and publish a bibliography of **research on dialogue systems for language learning**, a.k.a. dialogue-based computer-assisted language learning (dialogue-based CALL). Under these terms, we consider all applications allowing a learner of a second/foreign language to maintain a dialogue with a computer/automated agent. It includes **chatbots** (Eliza...), **dialogue systems** and **conversational agents** for language learning purposes, as well as **robots** (Nao...), **smart speakers** (Alexa...), **personal virtual assistants** (Siri...) and other interfaces.

## Up-to-date bibliography

The complete, updated bibliography is currently available on this repo in the following formats:

- [Zotero group public library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2778953/dialogue_systems_for_language_learning/library), for import to Zotero and potential collaboration and discussion on the list:
- [CSL JSON](https://github.com/sbibauw/dialogue-systems-for-language-learning-bibliography/blob/master/Bibliography.json), for import to Mendeley, Endnote or other reference managers
- [BibLaTeX](https://github.com/sbibauw/dialogue-systems-for-language-learning-bibliography/blob/master/Bibliography.bib), for use in LaTeX

## Detailed analysis of systems and studies
