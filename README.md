# Dialogue-based CALL - a bibliography

The purpose of this repository is to make available and help maintain a detailed bibliography of research on dialogue-based CALL. Under "dialogue-based CALL", we understand all applications allowing a learner of a second/foreign language to maintain a dialogue with a computer/automated agent. This includes **chatbots**, **dialogue systems** and **conversational agents** for language learning purposes, as well as **robots** and other interfaces.

Release expected: February 2018
