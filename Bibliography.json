		"abstract": "Foreign language anxiety (FLA) has been a perennial concern in language learning, as foreign language (FL) learners often communicate feelings of anxiety, stress, or nervousness. This study explored the role of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in speaking practice for FLA management of 48 undergraduate participants in an EFL class in Egypt. An eight-week, quasi-experimental pretest–posttest design examined learner anxiety levels using a 33-item FLA questionnaire. Their oral proficiency was assessed via roleplaying using an interaction-enhanced public version of the IELTS speaking evaluation rubric. The results confirmed that FL learners experienced FLA pre- and post-intervention. The identified anxiety levels played a facilitative role in FL learning with several ensuing gains. The use of conversationally enhanced AI chatbots in interactive activities slightly intensified learners' FLA, thus meriting further investigation of these objectives. Overall, subject to further development, AI chatbots are promising for significantly improving linguistic output gains; however, this study found that learners' speech-related anxieties were not reduced following the interactions with the chatbots. It is concluded that FLA plays an underexplored facilitative role in sharpening learner cognitive faculties and linguistic capacities. Moreover, AI chatbots may be beneficial in advancing FL learning with significant potential in EFL contexts, facilitating improved interaction and oral communication. These findings support the integration of AI technologies as effective tools in FL education, providing flexible, interactive, and learner-centred learning. This study is expected to be of considerable interest to FL educators and learners.",

Teaching practice experience in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom is critical, yet frequently unobtainable for students in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)/English Language Teaching (ELT) Masters programmes. This paper describes the design, development, and evaluation of a gamified simulation prototype, Virtual EFL Classroom, that was built to offer teaching practice opportunities to students in such programmes. Eleven Masters students enrolled in the ELT programme at Trinity College Dublin took part in this study. Findings indicate that participants enjoyed active experimentation in Virtual EFL Classroom and that it has the potential to enhance student-teachers’ decision-making skills, flexibility, and adaptability in planning and teaching learner-centred lessons.",

Chatbots are computer programs developed to engage in conversations with humans. They are designed as software avatars with limited, but growing conversational capability. The most natural and potentially powerful application of chatbots is in line with their fundamental nature - language practice. However, their role and outcomes within (in)formal language learning are currently tangential at best. Existing research in the area has generally focused on chatbots' comprehensibility and the motivation they inspire in their users. In this paper, we provide an overview of the chatbots for learning languages, critically analyze existing approaches, and discuss the major challenges for future work.",

However, little is known about the use of IPAs for Autonomous Second Language Learning (ASLL). Thus, the aims of this study were twofold: to assess Japanese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students’ perceptions towards IPAs, also known as virtual assistants, for ASLL, and to better understand learner behavior of these technologies. A total of 14 Japanese university students were given smart speakers and interacted with a companion IPA, Amazon Alexa, over a two-month period in their homes. Moreover, the participants completed a survey consisting of Likert-scale items and open-ended questions to obtain their views of the IPA for ASLL. While the results indicated that the students had mostly favorable views of Alexa for L2 learning, many of them did not actively engage with the virtual assistant during the data collection period. Furthermore, students tended to give up when faced with communication difficulties with the IPA. These findings highlight the potential of IPAs for ASLL and underscore the gap between what students say, and what they actually do, with language learning technology.",

		"abstract": "Advancement in digital technology has resulted in the development of Artificial Intelligence systems, which have found numerous applications in various fields such as economics and engineering.The field of education has also not been left behind in terms of AI adoption. Although theliterature illustrates the effectiveness of AI adoption in English as a Foreign Language (EFL learning), there is a scarcity of research on the perception of Saudi students towards AI adoption in EFL learning. Therefore, the current research investigatedthe perception of Saudi students towards AI usage in EFL learning, and how perception affects their acceptance of AI in EFL learning. Perception wasbroken down into several independent variables, which include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions while the dependent variable was the frequency of AI usage in EFL learning. The researcher adopteda quantitative cross-section and non-experimental research design to achieve the study objectives.The study sample consistedof 382 Saudi students drawn from various institutions in the United States. Purposive sampling wasused to select the sample, and the UTUAT model was used to generate a questionnaire for data collection. Finally, a linear regression model wasadopted to determine the association between perception and AI acceptance in EFL learning.The obtained performance expectancy score, facilitating conditions score,and social influence score was4 of 6 while the effort expectancy score was 5 of 6. It was also noted that the response regarding facilitating conditions in utilizing AI in EFLdiffered by gender. The study determined that only performance expectancyand social influence significantly predict the variation in the use of AI personal assistantsin EFL learning. Therefore, to increase the frequency of using AI \npersonal assistants in EFL learning among Saudi students, developers need to improve the components of thetools that directly enhance performanceexpectancies. Additionally, it is possible to generalize findings from this study considering the study sample did not only observe gender balance but was also drawn from diverse institutions in the United States.",

Therefore, one major trend of research, known as RobotAssisted Language Learning (RALL), is trying to develop robots to support teaching and learning English as a foreign language (EFL). As more practical studies on materials development have been called for, this paper details the methods of adopting the proposed RALL framework to design robot-assisted instructional materials for elementary students studying in an EFL national curriculum in Taiwan. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted in this research to investigate the learning performance and motivation of the designed robot-assisted instructional materials. Two groups of participants from an elementary school in Taiwan enrolled in this experiment. The post-test results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group, particularly in terms of the improvement of listening and reading skills. Furthermore, the motivation survey of the instructional materials also showed that the experimental group’s learning motivation was positively influenced. Therefore, our research demonstrated that the instructional materials developed by our RALL framework provide a great opportunity to foster elementary students’ English language learning.",

However, there can be potential costs to social interactions that could run counter to such goals. Here, we present an experiment testing the impact of a watchful versus non-watchful robot tutor on children's language-learning effort and performance. Across two interaction sessions, children learned French and Latin rules from a robot tutor and filled in worksheets applying the rules to translate phrases. Results indicate better performance on the worksheets in the session in which the robot looked away from, as compared to the session it looked toward the child, as the child was filling in the worksheets. This was the case in particular for the more difficult worksheet items. These findings highlight the need for careful implementation of social robot behaviors to avoid counterproductive effects.",

Hedonic aspects and motivating function, as well as the general usability and overall impression evoked by rabbit, were tested. A group of 18 5th grade students of an English class at a German junior high school were instructed to practice 20 pairs of vocabulary. Ten students were assisted by the speaking robot rabbit, while eight learned by applying an ordinary paper-and-pencil method. Results show that after one week, students who had learned with the Nabaztag had, on average, a higher recall than the control group. Moreover, the evaluation of the hedonic and pragmatic quality of interacting with the rabbit was high, as was the evaluation of both ease of use and perceived usefulness. Students learning with the rabbit were in a better mood afterwards than those who learned by means of the traditional method.",

The goal is to evaluate two ways for a robot to provide scaffolding for students: the use of iconic gestures, combined with adaptively choosing the next learning task based on the child»s past performance. The results show a positive effect on long-term memorization of novel words, and an overall higher level of engagement during the learning activities when gestures are used. The adaptive tutoring strategy reduces the extent to which the level of engagement is diminishing during the later part of the interaction.",

Traditionally, robots are programmed to provide feedback as teacher; we propose a robot that acts as a peer to motivate preschoolers during the tutoring. We conducted an experiment with 65 preschoolers (M = 3.6 years) in which the robot varied feedback in three conditions: peer-like (explicit negative), adult-like (explicit positive and implicit negative) and no feedback. The results suggest that feedback did not influence children's engagement (measured via eye-gaze), although children who received peer-like feedback seemed to perform more independently during the learning task (requiring less interventions from the experimenter).",

Forty-six female students, who were beginners at the age of 12, participated in this study and were randomly assigned into two groups of RALL (30 students) and non-RALL (16 students). The textbook, the materials, as well as the teacher were the same in the two groups. However in the RALL group, the treatment was given by a teacher accompanied by a humanoid robot assistant. Two questionnaires of anxiety and attitude were utilized to measure the students’ anxiety and attitude (Horwitz et al. 1986; Alemi and Alipour 2012). The results of descriptive and t tests indicated that there was lower anxiety and a more positive attitude towards English vocabulary acquisition in the RALL group compared with those in the non-RALL group. The study showed that the students in the RALL group had great fun in the learning process; they also believed they were learning more effectively, which helped them boost their motivation in the long run. The present study provides new insights into the use of technology in the language classroom, suggesting that teachers and material developers should integrate technology into the language learning process.",

		"abstract": "The present case study investigated the probable effect of applying a humanoid robot as a teacher-assistant for learning and retention of English vocabulary among 10 Iranian foreign language learners with intellectual disabilities, more specifically Down syndrome. This method is a new trend in using technology to teach classes called Robot Assisted Language Learning (RALL). To this end, participants were divided into 2 groups of five, one with the help of the robot (RALL) and one without (non-RALL). Both groups received the same lessons to learn 40 English vocabulary in 8 sessions. To measure the results, three English tests were run at different times during the teaching sessions (a pre-test, post-test, and a delayed post-test). The independent sample t-test on gain scores from pre-test to post-test revealed that there was a significant difference between the gains of the RALL group (M = 12.40) and the non-RALL group (M = 8.40), which indicates that RALL instruction had a large effect on the participants’ English vocabulary improvement. Moreover, while both RALL and non-RALL groups retained the taught vocabulary, the RALL group showed a more satisfying result. The findings of this study demonstrate the positive effects of using a humanoid robot to facilitate vocabulary learning and retention among people with Down syndrome who have issues with both language learning and verbal short-term memory and need to learn through visual activities, gestures, and games. This study could be a starting point for a new line of research in second or foreign language instruction specific to people with Down syndrome.",

Their attitude towards the robot was video recorded for one month, during ten sessions of their English classroom course. Their overall attitude was examined focusing on the three factors of anxiety, motivation and interaction based on human-robot interaction (HRI) theory. The result of this study showed that children’s motivation increased as a result of interacting with the robot and their anxiety reduced because of the friendly atmosphere the robot created. The results provided some important insights for using robots in classroom settings for young EFL (English as Foreign Language) students which may be also helpful for the future investigators.",

To this end, 38 preschool EFL children ranging from 3 to 6 years old were randomly assigned to the RALL (19 students) and game-based (19 students) groups, and the greeting sentences were extracted from the Functional Communication in English book [1] and ESL library website scenarios. In addition, the robot for the RALL group was used as an assistant to the teacher while for the game-based group the instruction was based on gaming methods such as command, mystery bag, and pass the ball. The instructional duration for both groups took eight sessions in which the RALL group was 8 hours and the non-RALL group took 32 hours to cover the same materials. After completion, the post-test of both groups were analyzed using independent samples t-test. The results revealed that there was a significant difference between the RALL and game-based groups' posttest performance. Thus, it can be argued that the RALL instruction was more effective than the game-based one in improving students' performance in posttest. Finally, the current study introduced a new teaching method for teaching greeting to EFL kids by employing a humanoid robot as a teaching assistant in the field of language teaching and learning.",

Moreover, the treatment given by a teacher accompanied by a humanoid robot assistant in the RALL group took about five weeks in which half of the book was covered, and the non-RALL group was taught in a traditional method. Finally, the teacher administered the post-test and delayed post-test whose results of repeated measures ANOVA and Two Ways ANOVA indicated that there was a significant difference regarding participants' vocabulary gain and retention in RALL group comparing to non-RALL group. In addition, the teacher reported the students' positive reaction to RALL in learning vocabulary. Overall, the results revealed that RALL has been very influential in creating an efficient and pleasurable English learning environment.

Students gave poor ratings for only four of 24 responses, and the vast majority thought the system would help with acquiring a new language.",

However, little is known about IPAs in the context of second language (L2) learning. Therefore, the primary objectives of this case study were twofold: to assess the ability of Amazon's IPA, Alexa, to understand L2 English utterances and to investigate student opinions of the IPA. Four university students of English as a foreign language (EFL) in Japan participated in the study, which involved each participant interacting with Alexa in a 20-min session. Three sets of data were collected and analyzed to achieve the study's aims: learner-generated command performance, interactive storytelling performance, and interviews. The quantitative results showed that Alexa accurately understood only 50% of learner commands, whereas comprehensibility during the interactive storytelling skill, Earplay, was much higher (90%). Three themes were identified from the interviews based on criteria developed by Hubbard (): hindered learner efficiency due to the lack of first language (L1) support, improved learner effectiveness through indirect pronunciation feedback, and better access to conversational opportunities. These findings demonstrate that EFL learners perceive Alexa to be a potentially useful tool to enhance language learning and underscore the need for additional (L2) research of IPAs.",

This study adopts a design-based research approach to investigate the pedagogical needs, the critical features and usability of such a authoring system. Twelve adult participants, including EFL teachers, parents, non-technical, and technical professionals, voluntarily participated in this study to co-develop and evaluated the authoring system through iterations of needs collection, system design, system testing and refinements. An authoring system, consisting of IoT-based toys, a robot and a script editor, was finally developed taking four cycles of iterative improvements in 18 weeks. Eleven pedagogical needs concerning children’s language and cognitive development, better children-robot interaction and practical issues were identified. The modifications made across different versions of the authoring system were presented in detail. The results also show that the issues of effectiveness, robustness and efficiency were the most frequently identified, and that the system had achieved good usability after four rounds of design and refinements. Design principles and guidelines also merged as a result providing insights into the effective design of Robot Assisted Language Learning in particular and Technology-Enhanced Language Learning in general.",

In the envisioned system, users will chat with a computer on topics ranging from relationship status to favorite Chinese dish. I hope to provide learners with more opportunities to practice speaking and reading foreign languages. The system was designed with generality in mind. The framework allows developers to easily implement dialogue systems to allow students to practice communications in a variety of situations, such as in a street market, at a restaurant, or in a hospital. A user simulator was also implemented, which was useful for the code development, as a tutor for the student, and as an evaluation tool. All of the 18 topics were covered within the 20 sample dialogues, no two dialogues took the same path, questions and remarks were worded differently, and no two users had the same profile, resulting in high variety, coherence, and natural language quality.",

		"abstract": "This article proposes a computer-based approach to effectively enhance second language learners' willingness to communicate in the target language. To do so, we implemented a conversational agent embedding a dialogue management model based on two conversational strategies (i.e., communication strategies and affective backchannels), serving as scaffolds for enhancing learners' willingness to communicate in the target language. Here, we report on differences observed among second language learners' preferences for both conversational strategies according to their initial level of willingness to communicate and on variations of their willingness with respect to such differences. Although we found that most students generally preferred a combination of both strategies, learners' preferences and the effects of the support provided by these strategies varied according to their level of willingness to communicate. Learners with lower willingness to communicate tended to prefer affective backchannels, whereas those with higher willingness to communicate seemed to favor communication strategies. These results were consistent with post-test results, which showed that learners' expected willingness to communicate tended to be higher after interacting with systems embedding their preferred strategies. In sum, these results are preliminary evidence of the meaningfulness of accounting for such learners' preferences in adaptively using and fading the strategies employed by conversational agents to motivate second language learners to communicate in the target language.",

		"abstract": "This article analyses how robot–learner interaction in robot-assisted language learning (RALL) is influenced by the interaction behaviour of the robot. Since the robot behaviour is to a large extent determined by the combination of teaching strategy, robot role and robot type, previous studies in RALL are first summarised with respect to which combinations that have been chosen, the rationale behind the choice and the effects on interaction and learning. The goal of the summary is to determine a suitable pedagogical set-up for RALL with adult learners, since previous RALL studies have almost exclusively been performed with children and youths. A user study in which 33 adult second language learners practice Swedish in three-party conversations with an anthropomorphic robot head is then presented. It is demonstrated how different robot interaction behaviours influence interaction between the robot and the learners and between the two learners. Through an analysis of learner interaction, collaboration and learner ratings for the different robot behaviours, it is observed that the learners were most positive towards the robot behaviour that focused on interviewing one learner at the time (highest average ratings), but that they were the most active in sessions when the robot encouraged learner–learner interaction. Moreover, the preferences and activity differed between learner pairs, depending on, e.g., their proficiency level and how well they knew the peer. It is therefore concluded that the robot behaviour needs to adapt to such factors. In addition, collaboration with the peer played an important part in conversation practice sessions to deal with linguistic difficulties or communication problems with the robot.",

In such a way, dialogue scenario designers could just focus on specifying domain-specific aspects of the dialogue scenario, which is expected to lessen new scenarios implementation effort and speed up the design process of various service-oriented dialogue situations.

Second, we verified the humanoid robot's ability to implement interaction with humans and applied the interface program to the learning of communication ability as an algorithm of self-learning. Third, various contents of a cloud app and a Facebook messenger chatbot have been applied to the study system that are mounted with iTunes and app store in all devices such as iPod, iPhone, iPad, Macintosh PC, and iTV. The subjects of study were 120 students from a university located in Cheonan, Choongnam. Achievement through the pre-test, post-test, and learning activities of the experimental group and the control group was analyzed, and statistical analysis was conducted through the survey of the experimental group. The research results are as follows. First, robots can enhance the interaction between content users such as students, content creators such as teachers, and actual material contents, which is very effective in foreign language education. Second, the educational robot-based learning system motivated learners in self-directed learning. Third, the pre-test and post-test results showed that the proposed learning system was effective in improving students' achievement by the learning system based on robots and AI applications.",

One of the open research issues in this arena concerns the identification of the most appropriate form of \"embodiment\" of the CA for children to interact with. To this end, we evaluated the linguistic performance of 14 neuro-typical children and 3 children with language impairment comparing different CAs - physical object and virtual character - with \"traditional\" human interaction. Based on our analysis, we identify insights for the design of CA: the physicality does influence the performance of linguistic tasks for children with linguistic impairment. In addition, children seem to show a preference for the physical CA and perceived it as smarter than the virtual one.",

However, implementing such systems in various situations requires significant knowledge-engineering effort, which limits their widespread adoption and deployment. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for dialogue scenario design based on an ontological model of service process. We provide an overview of a scenario authoring workflow and reduced number of activities that should be conducted by scenario designers to specify both the properties of the dialogue task structure and dialogue flow logic in the targeted conversation situation. We also discuss the benefits of embedding such a common service task structure in terms of reducing the authoring load of dialogue scenarios in various task-oriented service situations.",

The DM consists of turn-byturn utterances between the system and the learner. Therefore, the proposed method can automatically extend a new dialogue domain by constructing a dialogue map with a simple format. We constructed two dialogue maps for English and Korean, respectively, and implemented English and Korean task-oriented dialogue systems using the DMs. In the experiments, although the turn success rates are relatively low (78.1% in English and 78.76% in Korean), the task success rates are 90.83% in English and 99.17% in Korean. The systems constructed by the proposed method should enable learners to communicate successfully in the topic despite some mistakes in the system responses.",

This study addresses two gaps in our understanding of their development and support during university courses: how prior self-efficacy and interest plays a role in, and how different classroom activities build toward the development of students' future interest and self-efficacy. In this study the interplay between ability-beliefs (self-efficacy/self-concept) and interest at three levels of specificity (Domain, Course and Task) were tested across a Japanese university language course (n = 128). Within this test, students' interest in two language practice tasks (i.e., Human and then Chatbot partners) were assessed and compared. Prior interest was a robust predictor of all future task/course interest. Only Human-Human task interest directly predicted future course self-efficacy, but was mediated by course interest for future domain interest. For future interest, Human practice partners are superior to AIs. Supporting prior domain and later course interest should be a focus for university educators.",

Among the four language skills, speaking is the most anxiety-provoking skill. We investigated the presence of FLSA in Indonesian vocational high school students and we tested whether web-based language learning might help to reduce speaking anxiety, in particular when the facility in question is equipped with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). A mixed methods research was employed to investigate FLSA in 573 vocational high school students. A subset of them (n = 167) was selected to participate in two ASR-based web-experiments using www.iloveindonesia.my.id and NovoLearning. We additionally interviewed 11 of the students who participated in these web-experiments and five English teachers. The results showed that students indicated a moderate-to-serious level of FLSA, that they evaluated the learning websites positively, and believed that web-based language learning could alleviate their speaking anxiety. The interviews revealed that students felt less anxious when speaking in front of the ASR-based websites compared to speaking to peers or people. In order to evaluate the real effectiveness of ASR-based learning websites, future studies should investigate actual improvement of learners’ speaking skills over a longer period of time.",

		"abstract": "Often, second/foreign (L2) language learners receive little opportunity to interact orally in the target language. Interactive, conversation-based spoken dialog systems (SDSs) that use automated speech recognition and natural language processing have the potential to address this need by engaging learners in meaningful, goal-oriented speaking practice. However, these technology-based learning tools are often developed without input from teaching professionals. As part of a larger development effort, this study examined English as a second language (ESL) teachers’ perceptions regarding SDS-based speaking tasks, addressing the following research questions: (a) What do teachers think about the SDS-based tasks? (b) How would they use them in the context of their English instruction? Overall, 16 ESL instructors in an intensive English program in the United States were asked to interact with four SDS-based speaking tasks designed to elicit specific linguistic phenomena (e.g. making requests; wh-questions). The teachers completed a survey after each task to gauge their user experience, level of engagement, and perceptions of the usefulness of the tasks for their teaching contexts. A subgroup of instructors (n = 7) also participated in audio-recorded focus group meetings. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each survey item and the open-ended responses from the surveys and focus groups were analyzed qualitatively for major themes. The findings show that teachers had positive views of the SDS tasks’ potential for speaking practice and diagnostic purposes, primarily in a flipped classroom model. Their perceptions seemed to be related to their own user experience and, in particular, to the perceived authenticity of a given task.",

During the last decade, Robot-Assisted Language Learning (RALL) has attracted teachers’ and researchers’ attention due to the look and feel of humanoid robots. However, in the field of pragmatics, studies highlighting the role of RALL have gone relatively unnoticed. To bridge this gap, this study sought to explore the effect of RALL on pragmatic features, including request and thanking speech acts by young Persian-speaking EFL learners. For this aim, 38 preschool children (3 to 6 year-old boys and girls) with no English learning experience were randomly assigned to the RALL (19 students) and non-RALL (19 students) groups. In the RALL group, a humanoid robot was used as an assistant to the teacher to play games, repeat the sentences, and interact with the students. In the non-RALL group the lessons included games similar to those in the RALL group, but without the presence of the robot. There were eight one-hour teaching sessions over a period of four weeks for both groups. Following completion of the lessons in both groups, the results of post-tests were analyzed using an independent sample t-test. The findings revealed a significant difference between the RALL and non-RALL groups’ pragmatic performance for thanking and requesting. Based on these findings it can be concluded that RALL instruction was more effective than non-RALL instruction in improving the young learners’ performance.",

		"abstract": "Usage-based linguistics posits that communicative functions, including pragmatics, are at the core of language (Tomasello, 1992). It is surprising, then, that pragmatics is rarely systematically included in second language curricula (e.g., Bardovi-Harlig, 2017), especially since pragmatics instruction has been shown to significantly contribute to pragmatic development (e.g., Taguchi & Roever, 2017). Addressing this issue, the present study investigates learning outcomes and processes in self-access technology-enhanced instructional simulations for pragmatics that do not require classroom or teacher time. Importantly, these simulations include 1.) oral practice of extended discourse and 2.) feedback—two underexplored aspects of pragmatics instruction (e.g., Holden & Sykes, 2013; Sydorenko, Daurio, & Thorne, 2018).\nTwo versions of the self-access simulations were examined: implicit-only instruction (15 participants) and implicit combined with explicit instruction (11 participants). The quantitative analysis of learners’ production data and self-reported noticing revealed that both groups were similarly able to extract relevant (but varying) pragmatics features from instruction. The qualitative analysis, however, revealed that individual learner differences may be a critical factor in the effectiveness of implicit versus explicit instruction. The present study also illustrates how time spans and competition between cognitive resources affect pragmatics learning. In sum, this research informs further development of self-access pragmatics materials.",

		"abstract": "Limited linguistic coverage for Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs) means that many interact in a non-native language. Yet we know little about how IPAs currently support or hinder these users. Through native (L1) and non-native (L2) English speakers interacting with Google Assistant on a smartphone and smart speaker, we aim to understand this more deeply. Interviews revealed that L2 speakers prioritised utterance planning around perceived linguistic limitations, as opposed to L1 speakers prioritising succinctness because of system limitations. L2 speakers see IPAs as insensitive to linguistic needs resulting in failed interaction. L2 speakers clearly preferred using smartphones, as visual feedback supported diagnoses of communication breakdowns whilst allowing time to process query results. Conversely, L1 speakers preferred smart speakers, with audio feedback being seen as sufficient. We discuss the need to tailor the IPA experience for L2 users, emphasising visual feedback whilst reducing the burden of language production.",

The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of the use of artificial intelligence chatbots on improving Korean college students' English grammar skills. 70 undergraduate students participated in the present study. They were taking a General English class offered by a university in Korea. There were two groups in this study. Participants in the chatbot group consisted of 36 students while those in the human group were 34. Over 16 weeks, the chatbot group engaged in ten chat sessions with a chatbot while the human group had a chat with a human chat partner. Both pre- and post-tests were performed to examine changes in the participants' grammar skills over time. To compare the improvement between the two groups, an independent t-test was then run. Main findings are as follows: First, participants in both groups significantly improved their English grammar skills, indicating the beneficial effects of engaging in chat. Also, there was a statistically significant difference in the improvement between the chatbot and human groups, indicating the superior effects of the chatbot use. This study confirmed the improved grammar skills by the participants in the chatbot group, comparison with those in the human group. Based on these findings, suggestions for the future chatbot study are discussed.",

In this paper, two different types of chatbots (pedagogical chatbot Tutor Mike and conversational chatbot Mitsuku) were selected to investigate their potential for foreign language learning by exploring the frequency and patterns of Negotiation for Meaning (NfM) in CMC interactions. 8 Chinese EFL leaners were randomly divided into two groups (lower and higher-level learners), and all learners interacted with both the pedagogical and conversational chatbot in a switching replications research design. Data were analysed through content analysis to identify the number of NfM instances observed, the different stages of NfM, trigger types, modified output and learners’ perceptions. The findings of this study indicate that while learners with low language levels would benefit most from interactions with pedagogical agents, high language level learners expressed dissatisfaction with chatbots and a low level of engagement was observed in their interactions with the pedagogical chatbot.",

		"abstract": "New technology such as fully-automated interactive spoken dialogue systems (SDS), which allow learners to engage in multi-turn conversations with an automated agent, could provide a means for second and foreign language learners (L2) to practice form-function-context mappings in oral interaction. In this study, we investigated how learners interacted with an automated agent as they engaged in an SDS task that required them to make two requests. We examined the requests employed by 107 L2 learners, exploring in particular the request strategies and modifications used. We first transcribed verbatim all audio-recorded dialogues. Then, all turns were coded as to whether they contained a request or not. All turns that were identified as including requests were then coded for four categories adopted from Cross-cultural Speech Act Realization Patterns project: (1) Level of directness, (2) Request strategy, (3) External modifiers, and (4) Internal modifiers. Direct requests were most frequently used and learners’ preferred request strategies were want-statements and query preparatories. Additionally, they employed more internal than external modifications – a finding that seems contrary to most interlanguage studies on request realization. Moreover, we found distinct request realizations when comparing L1 Hungarian and L1 Japanese learners of English. We discuss the findings with regard to previous interlanguage studies on request realization, the potential impact of an automated agent, and ways automated spoken dialog systems might be used to implement individualized feedback to raise learners’ pragmatic awareness.",

Drawing upon audio-recordings of role-play conversations between an L1 American English speaker and 104 L2 English learners, we use conversation analysis to examine how L2 learners respond to yes/no questions in an oral performance assessment. The analysis was guided by the following research questions: (a) How do L2 English learners respond to a yes/no interrogative in a role-play assessment context? (b) How do L2 English learners’ different responses lead to distinct sequences of conversational turns? In our analysis we show that yes/no interrogatives elicit a range of responses (e.g., repair initiation, type-conforming responses, non-type-conforming responses) that result in negotiation of meaning between participants. While turn design and sequence organization features we observed largely align with the existing literature on naturally occurring conversations, we also discuss deviant cases that provide insights into L2 learner discourse. Moreover, we discuss the findings in terms of implications for L2 assessment.",

		"abstract": "Though substantial research has been dedicated towards using technology to improve education, no current methods are as effective as one-on-one tutoring. A critical, though relatively understudied, aspect of effective tutoring is modulating the student's affective state throughout the tutoring session in order to maximize long-term learning gains. We developed an integrated experimental paradigm in which children play a second-language learning game on a tablet, in collaboration with a fully autonomous social robotic learning companion. As part of the system, we measured children's valence and engagement via an automatic facial expression analysis system. These signals were combined into a reward signal that fed into the robot's affective reinforcement learning algorithm. Over several sessions, the robot played the game and personalized its motivational strategies (using verbal and non-verbal actions) to each student. We evaluated this system with 34 children in preschool classrooms for a duration of two months. We saw that (1) children learned new words from the repeated tutoring sessions, (2) the affective policy personalized to students over the duration of the study, and (3) students who interacted with a robot that personalized its affective feedback strategy showed a significant increase in valence, as compared to students who interacted with a non-personalizing robot. This integrated system of tablet-based educational content, affective sensing, affective policy learning, and an autonomous social robot holds great promise for a more comprehensive approach to personalized tutoring.",

Thirty participants participated in an experiment, throughout which they were asked to wear a NeuroSky Mindwave headset to assess their real-time levels of attention and meditation, as well as their brainwave activities in each of the three contexts. Statistical analyses of the results revealed a significant effect of the EFL socialization context on participants’ level of attention and meditation. The EFL learners’ level of attention was highest when they were socializing with other humans in person. When their interlocutor was a chatbot, their level of meditation was highest. When they were interacting with another person in a virtual environment, both their attention and meditation were lowest. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of the dominant ratios of participants’ brainwave activities, based on their interactions with interlocutors in all three contexts. The AI chatbot was associated with the greatest dominant ratio of delta and theta brainwaves for EFL learners. Face-to-face L2 socialization with interlocutors triggered alpha and beta brainwaves, whereas interaction with human interlocutors in the virtual environment made gamma brainwaves dominant. The present study is the first to have empirically examined EFL learners’ levels of attention and meditation as well as brainwaves during L2 socialization in three different contexts.",

Thus, this study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the in-class use of the IPA, Alexa, among second language (L2) English students to support improvements in listening comprehension and speaking proficiency. The study utilized a quasi-experimental design with an experimental group (n = 13) which took part in a 10-week treatment of student-IPA interaction and a control group (n = 15) which did not. Results from the Mann-Whitney U test found that the experimental group was able to make more significant gains in L2 speaking proficiency. However, a significant difference was not found when comparing improvements in L2 listening comprehension. These findings suggest that IPAs may be a useful tool to promote L2 speaking skills and underscore the necessity for additional research on the emerging technology for language learning.",

Based on the sociocultural perspectives of learning, such as communication to recognize the difference from others and to be involved in sense-making processes, this study examines the automated translation chatbot to translate L1 statements into L2 automatically during online interactions by hypothesizing that the chatbot provides a variety of L2 comprehensive input and lowers learners’ anxiety to write their L2 posts, which will lead to successful L2 learning. To verify our hypothesis, quantitative and qualitative data was collected by the online interaction, essay writing tasks, and open-ended questionnaire before and after the interaction. The findings of this study will suggest that the efficient use of an online translation bot facilitates collaborative dialog and results in more successful L2 learning.",

The current study aims to find out how second language (L2) vocabulary gains differ depending on whether children are learning by themselves, with a child peer, or with a robot peer. Children were administered an L2 vocabulary training in one of these three conditions. Children's word learning was measured directly after the training and one week later. Contrary to our expectations, children learning by themselves outperformed children in the peer conditions on one out of four word knowledge tasks. On the other tasks, there were no differences between the three conditions. Suggestions to further study the potential benefits of a robot peer are provided.",

The field of robot-assisted language learning (RALL) is developing rapidly. Studies have been published targeting different languages, age groups, and aspects of language and using different robots and methodologies. The present review presents an overview of the results obtained so far in RALL research and discusses the current possibilities and limitations of using social robots for first- and second-language learning. Thirty-three studies in which vocabulary, reading skills, speaking skills, grammar, and sign language were taught are discussed. Beside insights into learning gains attained in RALL situations, these studies raise more general issues regarding students’ motivation and robots’ social behavior in learning situations. This review concludes with directions for future research on the use of social robots in language education.",

It ﬁrst outlines advantages and challenges of using automated multi-turn conversations to help learners practice pragmatic moves. In order to deal with a particular challenge–excessive variability in users’ pragmatic performances–an interactive dialogue aimed at eliciting requests was deployed via a crowdsourcing platform. A total of 328 completed conversations, with both L1 and L2 English speakers, were collected and analyzed with regard to number of turns and requests as well as request strategies elicited in the conversations. Requests were coded based on head acts as direct (D), conventionally indirect (CI), and hint (H). The results revealed interesting patterns in both L1 and L2 speaker responses. For example, even though they were speaking to the same interlocutor, L1 speakers tended to use different request strategies for two distinct requests, dependent on the interaction sequence and prompts within the dialogue. Moreover, further culture-speciﬁc variability was identiﬁed. Finally, the implications of the ﬁndings for the design and use of systematic feedback on pragmatics in computer-assisted language learning applications is discussed.",

For example, we know very little about potential errors young L2 learners make when they produce yes/no questions–an area that is crucial in order to provide useful feedback in different learning environments, including computer-based applications. This paper reports on an exploratory study conducted with Can you guess who I am?, an interactive, spoken-dialogue-based speaking activity that allows young English learners to practice yes/no questions. After introducing the SDS-based speaking activity, we present the ﬁndings from a systematic investigation of the output produced by 27 young English learners in Germany (ages 9-11) who engaged with the activity. A particular focus in the analysis was placed on the types of yes/no questions elicited and the types of errors made by the young learners. The ﬁndings provide further empirical support for a six-stage framework for the development of question formation in L2 learners [14]. Moreover, they offer insights into the types of errors young EFL learners make in forming polar interrogatives such as systematic confusion with regard to the auxiliaries “to be” and “to do”. The ﬁndings are discussed in terms of (a) how they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of young learner’s speech and (b) how they will be used to inform further development of more targeted feedback options that can be implemented into the SDSbased speaking activity in order to harness its full potential for L2 learning.",

Following the evidence-centered design (ECD) framework, we then outline the design of the prototype end-of-unit assessment module for Unit 3, a unit that deals with the speech act of request in general workplace communication. After presenting the proficiency model, the evidence model, and the task model, we provide in detail an overview of the task and item designs, including feedback implementation and ideas for scoring.

We investigate automated prediction of multiple such metrics collected from crowdsourced interactions with an open-source, cloud-based multimodal dialog system in the educational domain. We extract features from both the audio and video signals and examine the efficacy of multiple machine learning algorithms in predicting these performance metrics. The best performing audio features consist of multiple low-level audio descriptors—intensity, loudness, cepstra, pitch, and so on—and their functionals, extracted using the OpenSMILE toolkit, while the video features are bags of visual words that use 3D Scale-Invariant Feature Transform descriptors. We find that our proposed methods outperform the majority vote classification baseline in predicting various UX metrics rated by both the user and experts. Our results suggest that such automated prediction of performance metrics can not only inform the qualitative and quantitative analysis of dialogs but also be potentially incorporated into dialog management routines for positively impacting UX and other metrics during the course of the interaction.",

		"abstract": "While dialog systems have been widely deployed for computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and formative assessment systems in recent years, relatively limited work has been done with respect to the psychometrics and validity of these technologies in evaluating and providing feedback regarding student learning and conversational ability. This paper formulates a Markov decision process based measurement model, and applies it to text chat data collected from crowdsourced native and non-native English language speakers interacting with an automated dialog agent. We investigate how well the model measures speaker conversational ability, and find that it effectively captures the differences in how native and non-native speakers of English accomplish the dialog task. Such models could have important implications for CALL systems of the future that effectively combine dialog management with measurement of learner conversational ability in real-time.",

		"abstract": "Robots increasingly have the potential to interact with people in daily life. It is believed that, based on this ability, they will play an essential role in human society in the not-so-distant future. This article examined the proposition that robots could form relationships with children and that children might learn from robots as they learn from other children. In this article, this idea is studied in an 18-day field trial held at a Japanese elementary school. Two English-speaking \"Robovie\" robots interacted with first- and sixth-grade pupils at the perimeter of their respective classrooms. Using wireless identification tags and sensors, these robots identified and interacted with children who came near them. The robots gestured and spoke English with the children, using a vocabulary of about 300 sentences for speaking and 50 words for recognition. The children were given a brief picture-word matching English test at the start of the trial, after 1 week and after 2 weeks. Interactions were counted using the tags, and video and audio were recorded. In the majority of cases, a child's friends were present during the interactions. Interaction with the robot was frequent in the 1st week, and then it fell off sharply by the 2nd week. Nonetheless, some children continued to interact with the robot. Interaction time during the 2nd week predicted improvements in English skill at the posttest, controlling for pretest scores. Further analyses indicate that the robots may have been more successful in establishing common ground and influence when the children already had some initial proficiency or interest in English. These results suggest that interactive robots should be designed to have something in common with their users, providing a social as well as technical challenge.",

How the speaking construct is defined determines one’s evaluation of the extent to which assessments using these technologies are adequate to the task, given different test use contexts, and what the challenges and future research requirements are.

		"abstract": "Conversation practice, while paramount for all language learners, can be difficult to get enough of and very expensive. In this mobile age, chatbots are an obvious means of filling this gap, but have yet to realize their potential as practice partners. The current study was undertaken to examine why chatbots are not yet a substantial instrument for language learning engagement/practice, and to provide direction for future practice and chatbot development. To this end, building on a recent experimental study examining chatbot novelty effects, students undertook a pair of conversation activities: human and human-chatbot (via speech-to-text software). Immediately following the practice conversations, students' interest in the two partners was surveyed and open-ended textual feedback was collected. With these data sources and prior standardised test results, regression and content analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings indicated: 1) prior interest in human conversation partners was the best single predictor of future interest in chatbot conversations; 2) prior language competency was more strongly linked to interest in chatbot than human conversations; 3) that the qualitative experience of having “learned more” with the chatbot was strongly connected to task interest, even when reporting communication difficulties. Implications for practicing languages with currently available chatbots, for chatbots and related educational technology as sources of student interest and directions for chatbots future development are discussed.",

Applied Linguistics, 21(4), 431–462]. The use of smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and its associated voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant (IPA) Alexa can help address this limitation because of its ability to extend the reach of the classroom, motivate practice, and encourage self-learning. Our previous study on the pedagogical use of Echo revealed that its use gave L2 learners ample opportunities for stress-free input exposure and output practice [Moussalli, S., & Cardoso, W. (2016). Are commercial ‘personal robots’ ready for language learning? Focus on second language speech. In S. Papadima-Sophocleous, L. Bradley, & S. Thouësny (Eds.), CALL communities and culture – short papers from EUROCALL 2016 (pp. 325–329). However, the results also suggested that beginner learners, depending on their levels of accentedness, experienced difficulties interacting with and being understood by Echo. Interestingly, this observation differs from findings involving human-to-human interactions, which suggest that a speaker’s foreign accent does not impede intelligibility. In this article, we report the results of a study that investigated Echo’s ability to recognize and process non-native accented speech at different levels of accentedness, based on the accuracy of its replies for a set of pre-established questions. Using a variety of analytical methods (i.e. judges’ ratings of learners’ pronunciation, learners’ ratings of Echo’s pronunciation, transcriptions of Echo’s interactions, surveys and interviews) and via a multidimensional analysis of the data collected, our results indicate that L2 learners have no problems understanding Echo and that it adapts well to their accented speech (Echo is comparable to humans in terms of comprehensibility and intelligibility). Our results also show that L2 learners use a variety of strategies to mitigate the communication breakdown they experienced with Echo.",

		"abstract": "The construct of oral ability is multifaceted, but due to technological and practical constraints, the majority of computer-delivered speaking assessments are designed to measure only certain aspects of this ability. Most notably, interactional competence, which we define as the ability to actively structure dialogic speech in real time, is often not assessed. Innovations in technology, namely, computer- mediated video, make it possible for test takers in different locations to see and speak with others in real time and may make it achievable for computer-based tests to assess more aspects of oral communication, including interactional competence. This report gives the find- ings from a study that explored to what extent computer-mediated video, namely, Skype, could function in conjunction with a platform designed to present four innovative speaking tasks that could conceivably assess a broad construct of oral ability. The overarching goals of this project were twofold. First, we aimed to determine (a) the degree to which current computer video-mediated technology can be used effectively to deliver assessments remotely and (b) the extent to which participants felt that four specific tasks could assess speaking ability by means of this technology. The speaking tasks included giving short responses to an interlocutor’s questions, sum- marizing a proposal, defending a position in a group discussion, and giving a prepared presentation and responding to questions from other participants. Two data collections were conducted: one with all 72 participants located in the United States and one with all 74 participants located in China. The findings provide preliminary evidence that the stability of computer video-mediated technology varies considerably, with technical disruptions being relatively few in the U.S. trial but very frequent in the China context. Moreover, the findings suggest that participants viewed the tasks as generally representing interactive speaking activities that they encounter in the oral language use domain, affording them the opportunity to demonstrate their oral abilities, and that these tasks can be effectively completed in a computer video-mediated environment when technology cooperates.",

In this video game-like environment, the user is asked to solve given tasks in the game and in order to complete them he/she must interact with the characters, e.g. by conversing with them on context- specific topics. To make this a reality, a model for how natural conversations start in a specific situations has been developed, based on data from that same situation in real life: a stranger asking another stranger for directions to a particular place in downtown Reykjavik. This involved defining a multimodal an- notation scheme, outlining the communicative functions and behaviors associated with them. However, current annotation schemes lacked the appropriate function for this specific case, which lead us to finding and proposing an appropriate commu-nicative function – the Explicit Announcement of Presence. A study was conducted to explore and better understand how conversation is initiated in first encounters between people who do not know each other. Human-to-human conversations were analyzed for the purpose of modelling a realistic conversation between human users and virtual agents. Results from the study have led to the inclusion of the communicative function in the human-to-agent conversation system. By playing the game the learners will be exposed to situations that they may encounter in real life, and therefore the interaction is based on real life data, rather than textbook examples. We believe that this application will help bridge the gap from the class room to the real world, preparing learners to initiate conversations with real Icelandic speakers.",

This paper describes a novel robot-assisted language learning system that induces the human learner into a triad conversation with two robots through which he or she improves practical communication skills in various conversational situations. The system applies implicit learning as the main learning style for conveying linguistic knowledge, in an indirect way, through conversations on several topics. A series of experiments was conducted using 80 recruited participants to evaluate the effect of implicit learning and the retention effect in a joining-in-type robot-assisted language learning system. The experimental results show positive effects of implicit learning and repetitive learning in general. Based on these experimental results, we propose an improved method, integrating implicit learning and tutoring with corrective feedback in an adaptive way, to increase performance in practical communication skills even for a wide variety of proficiency of L2 learners.",

		"abstract": "This article presents the results of a systematic review of the literature on dialogue-based CALL, resulting in a conceptual framework for research on the matter. Applications allowing a learner to have a conversation in a foreign language with a computer have been studied from various perspectives and under different names (dialogue systems, conversational agents, chatbots…). Considering the fragmentation of what we identify under the term dialogue-based CALL, we attempt to offer a structured overview of these efforts into a conceptual framework. Through a methodical search strategy, we collected a corpus of 343 publications. From this corpus, we formalized an operational definition of dialogue-based CALL, which allowed us to identify 96 relevant systems. Analyzing the type of dialogue they offer, on a continuum of constraints on form and meaning, we propose to classify those systems into four groups. We have called these branching, form-focused, goal-oriented and reactive systems, and we describe their corresponding interactional, instructional and technological traits. We summarize the main results from empirical studies on such systems, distinguishing observational, survey and experimental studies, and discuss the impact of dialogue-based CALL on motivation and L2 development, identifying positive evidence on both outcomes. Finally, we propose two main avenues for future research: relative effectiveness of dialogue-based CALL approaches, and dialogue systems as an environment for testing SLA hypotheses.",

		"abstract": "The importance of authentic communicative practices in foreign language (FL) learning has long been recognized. However, most FL learners lack adequate access to authentic communicative environments in the target language. In this article, we propose the use of telepresence robots as a potential solution to bridge this gap. Telepresence robots can be controlled by remote language learners online, enabling them to gain virtual access to authentic environments in the target language and to interact with native speakers in those environments in real time. In this exploratory study, three English learners and a native-speaker of American English participated in a campus tour activity using a telepresence robot. We examined the experience of our participants and the conversational features of their telepresence interactions through analyses of the interview data, field notes, and transcripts of conversations captured on video. Our findings show that telepresence robots have substantial potential for promoting FL learning by providing authentic communicative practice for remote language learners. The findings have useful implications for informing future research design.",

		"abstract": "The present study offers a meta-analysis of effectiveness studies on dialogue-based CALL, i.e., systems allowing a learner to practice a second language (L2) by interacting with a conversational agent (“bot”). Through a systematic inclusion and exclusion process, screening 419 publications, we identified 17 relevant meta-analysable studies. We made use of Morris and DeShon’s (2002) formulas to compute comparable effect sizes across designs, including k = 100 individual effect sizes, which were analysed through a multilevel random-effects model. Results confirm that dialogue-based CALL practice has a significant medium effect size on L2 proficiency development (d = 0.59). We performed extensive moderator analyses to explore the relative effectiveness on several learning outcomes of different types and features of dialogue-based CALL (type of interaction, modality, agent embodiment, etc.). In particular, our study confirms the effectiveness of form-focused and goal-oriented systems, system-guided interactions, corrective feedback provision, and gamification features. Significant effects for lower proficiency learners, and on vocabulary, morphosyntax, holistic proficiency and accuracy are established. Finally, we discuss evolutions to be expected in dialogue-based CALL and the language learning opportunities it offers.",

Willingness to communicate (WTC) in a second language is believed to have a direct and sustained influence on learners’ actual usage frequency of the target language. To help overcome the lack of suitable environments for increasing L2 learners’ WTC, our approach is to build embodied conversational agents that can help learners surmount their apprehension towards communication in L2. Here, we focus on the dialogue management aspects of our approach and propose a model based on a set of communication strategies (CS) and affective backchannels (AB) to foster such agents’ ability to carry on natural and WTC-friendly conversations with learners. We examined learners’ expected WTC after interacting with one of the following versions of the system: an agent featuring both CS and AB; an agent featuring only CS; and an agent featuring only AB. The results suggested that combining CS and AB empowers the conversational agent and leads to higher expected WTC among L2 learners. We also found that even the AB-only version of the system had the potential to enhance WTC to some extent. These findings are evidence of the feasibility of enhancing L2 learners’ engagement towards communication using a computer-based environment coupled with appropriate conversational strategies.",

However, few technology-enhanced self-access tools are available for pragmatic development, especially in oral modality. Recognizing the benefits of structured practice for second language development, we demonstrate how such practice can be incorporated into three recently developed simulated speaking environments that vary on the targeted L2 (French, English), domain of use (academic or everyday interaction), emphasis on higher-order and/or lower-order skills, and accommodation of multiple L2 varieties. In the spirit of finding synergies and learning from each other's experiences in specific local contexts, we address the following research questions: (1) How does the local context, researcher and learner goals, and technological possibilities influence the design of each computer application? (2) Based on the examination of the three programs, what can we learn in view of redesign options and suggest to future developers of such programs?",

		"abstract": "Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has been one of the first incarnations of E-Learning, which has not only become a trend nowadays but also a commercial factor. CALL has its own international conferences and a wide range of academic prototypes and commercial products are available. As with E-Learning software in general, advanced CALL systems are based on the principles of multi media design, facilitating modalities like audio and video, e.g. speech input and output, animated graphics and avatars for guiding the user. Although these design standards do improve the quality of E-Learning systems, it is widely accepted that an optimal learning environment is one where the learner is guided by an intelligent personalized tutor, that adapts to the level of expertise of the learner, for example in tailoring explanations to the user's domain knowledge and selecting appropriate exercises. This is the area of Intelligent Tutorial Systems (ITS) and User Modelling (UM), so far a mainly academic discipline. If at all, only few commercial (CALL) products incorporate such capabilities. The problem is that domain knowledge, reasoning and learning facilities and - in the case of verbal explanations - natural language understanding capabilities are to be integrated; altogether a non-trivial task for many application areas. As a consequence, intelligent tutorial systems seem to be suited well only for restricted domains, e.g. circuit design (Davis 1984).",

Learners can practice conversation with the EDC system in English. In order to motivate the learners, we design the three learning activities to enhance the environment of English learning, which are the choice of learning companion phase, the conversation phase, and the teaching phase. We also conducted a pilot study to evaluate the EDC system. The results showed the subjects agreed that the system is positive and useful. For the most of learners, we found that the most favorite learning activity is to teach learning companion. In addition, the greater part of learners liked the same gender learning companion. And learners selected the learning companion depended on the learning companion is regards as a classmate or a teacher.",

However, empirical evidence evaluating their e ectiveness for the learning of L2 pragmatics is very limited.  is chapter adds to this small body of empirical treatments of L2 pragmatic development in MUVEs. Speci cally, it reports on the e ectiveness of the use of a synthetic immersive environment (i.e., an MUVE created with an explicit educational orientation) for the development of learners’ apologies in Spanish. Data were collected as part of a larger study addressing L2 pragmatic development in syn- thetic immersive environments (Sykes, 2008). Utilizing a mixed method, pre- post design, data from twenty- ve advanced learners of Spanish were analyzed in terms of participants’ actual pragmalinguistic abilities (pretest/posttest) and perceptive pragmatic abilities (interviews, in-class activities, pre-post survey). Results demonstrate a modest change in pragmatic abilities from pretest to posttest. However, the evidence suggests a strong qualitative shi  in learners’ perceptions of their own pragmatic abilities.",

		"abstract": "Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) proposed by Mishra and Koehler is a theoretical construct of teacher knowledge that describes how teachers teach subject matter content using certain instructional methods with specific technology in particular contexts. This study aims to explore the interface between TPACK and SLA, intending to examine (a) how a Taiwanese English teacher enhanced L2 interaction and (b) how her students perceived such teaching. While data regarding the teacher's TPACK-SLA knowledge was collected through lesson plans, classroom observations, and interviews, data associated with students’ perceptions was obtained through a questionnaire survey and focus-group interviews. The findings suggest that the teacher enhanced L2 interaction by(a) drawing students’ attention to grammatical patterns through annotated animations, (b) consolidating vocabulary use through image-based exercises and a bilingual concordancer, and (c) evaluating the use of sentence patterns through text-chatting with a chatbot. While the students could improve learner-computer interaction through obtaining enhanced input, they could also develop inter-personal communication competency through negotiating meaning. In addition, the students appreciated the ways their teacher taught English using Cool English. This study contributes some empirical insights into how EFL teachers can draw upon practices explored in instructed SLA to develop TPACK.",

		"abstract": "The development of prototype Spoken Dialog Systems (SDS) for computer assisted language learning (CALL) applications has become easier in recent years due to dramatic improvements in the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and the availability of open-source tools for the components of the SDS pipeline. Such SDS-based language learning prototypes have the potential to create an interactive, engaging language learning environment and to provide real-time, individualized feedback to learners. However, while an initial prototype SDS that successfully processes a limited range of expected learner responses can be developed rather quickly, the iterative refinement of the system to enable it to accurately respond to the wide range of learner responses—responses that differ due to students’ first (L1) and/or second language (L2) proficiency, cultural backgrounds etc.—can be extremely time-consuming and challenging. This can limit the usefulness of SDS-based CALL applications to specific learner populations and contexts.\nIn this study, we attempt to address challenges related to the scalability and generalizability of SDS-based CALL applications through an analysis of common types of problems that these systems encounter when they are used in multiple contexts. Specifically, we used the open-source HALEF SDS framework to design interactive conversational tasks for L2 English learners for a wide range of situations such as ordering food in a restaurant, interviewing for a job, and disputing a bill. These conversational tasks were deployed on the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform and conversational responses were collected from over 2,000 L2 speakers of English representing over 50 different L1 backgrounds. The responses were transcribed and analyzed to determine characteristics of learner responses that resulted in sub-optimal system behavior since they did not conform to the initial patterns that the prototypes were designed to handle. In this presentation, we will present a taxonomy of the types of variability that were observed due to L1 and local context, covering the following aspects of the learner's speech: grammar, vocabulary, pragmatics, and cultural knowledge. These findings will help establish best practices for developing SDS-based CALL applications that can more accurately process a wider range of responses due to differences in learner characteristics and can therefore be applied in a broader set of educational environments. We will also discuss strategies that can be used by SDS designers to make the applications more robust to variability.",

		"abstract": "This paper introduces a Dialog-Based Computer Assisted second-Language Learning (DB-CALL) system using task-oriented dialogue processing technology. The system promotes dialogue with a second-language learner for a specific task, such as purchasing tour tickets, ordering food, passing through immigration, etc. The dialog system plays a role of a ticket agent, a waiter, or an immigration officer at each task and the learner completes the task through talking with the system in the second-languages. The system gives a new situation of the task at every trial, so that the learner could have a different experience and learn various expressions in the same task. Our DB-CALL system is based on a task-oriented dialog system consisting of a language understanding module using a structural support vector model and a dynamic dialog graph based dialog management module. Our task-oriented dialog system is trained from the intention-annotated real dialog scripts. The experiments for the performance of our proposed dialog system show the average task success rate of 85.52%, the average turn success rate of 85.32%, and the average turn length of 14.61. In a satisfactory survey targeting the subjects, the subjects agreed that our system makes them learn the second-language more efficiently and with less effort.

A human tutor aids learners by:\n• Providing a framework of tasks suitable to the learner’s needs\n• Continuously monitoring learner progress and adapting task content and delivery style\n• Providing a source of speaking practice and motivation\nMILLA is a prototype language tuition system comprising tuition management, learner state monitoring, and an adaptable curriculum, all mediated through speech. The system enrols and monitors learners via a spoken dialogue interface, provides pronunciation practice and automatic error correction in two modalities, grammar exercises, and two custom speech-to-speech chatbots for spoken interaction practice. The focus on speech in the tutor’s output and in the learning modules addresses the current deficit in spoken interaction practice in Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL) applications, with different text-to-speech (TTS) voices used to provide a variety of speech models across the different modules. The system monitors learner engagement using Kinect sensors and checks pronunciation and responds to dialogue using automatic speech recognition (ASR). A learner record is used in conjunction with the curriculum to provide activities relevant to the learner’s current abilities and first language, and to monitor and record progress.",

Thirty students enrolled in Chinese classes in a U.S. university interacted with characters in videos featuring scenes recorded in Shanghai. Students were prompted to use formulaic expressions during their text-based interactions with built-in characters. Several game-like features were incorporated into the practice (e.g., a plot and settings, character selections, and point systems). Pre-, post-, and delayed posttest results showed that students made significant gains in their knowledge of formulaic expressions after the practice, and their knowledge was maintained 2 weeks later. Interviews with individual students revealed some features that motivated them with the practice (e.g., videorecordings of authentic situations, interactions with the characters). However, some students did not perceive the practice as a game-like experience because of the linear, structured nature of the practice and limited decision-making power, leaving room for design improvement in the future.",

The study investigates the students’ ability to practice English by chatting with a virtual agent designed to teach ESL learners. The researcher used situated learning and constructivist learning theories as theoretical underpinnings. Survey results of students’ perceptions and teachers’ reflections on their teaching strategies show that students’ levels and language skills are important factors in determining the e ectiveness of chatbot use in the classroom.",

		"abstract": "Novel technology can be a powerful tool for enhancing students' interest in many learning domains. However, the sustainability and overall impact of such interest is unclear. This study tests the longer-term effects of technology on students' task and course interest. The experimental study was conducted with students in foreign language classes (n = 122): a 12-week experimental trial that included pre- and post-course interest, and a sequence of task interest measures. Employing a counterbalanced design, at three week intervals students engaged in separate speaking tasks with each of a Human and “Chatbot” partner. Students' interest in successive tasks and in the course (pre-post), were used to assess differential partner effects and course interest development trajectories. Comparisons of task interest under different partner conditions over time indicated a significant drop in students' task interest with the Chatbot but not Human partner. After accounting for initial course interest, Structural Equation Modelling indicated that only task interest with the Human partner contributed to developing course interest. While Human partner task interest predicted future course interest, task interest under Chatbot partner conditions did not. Under Chatbot partner conditions there was a drop in task interest after the first task: a novelty effect. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",

		"abstract": "This research analyses participants’ orientation to linguistic identities in chat and intro- duces data-driven computational models for communicative Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (communicative ICALL). Based on non-pedagogical chat conversa- tions between native speakers and non-native speakers, computational models of the fol- lowing types are presented: exposed and embedded corrections, explanations of unknown words following learner’s request. Conversation Analysis helped to obtain patterns from a corpus of dyadic chat conversations in a longitudinal setting, bringing together German native speakers and advanced learners of German as a foreign language. More specifically, this work states a bottom-up, data-driven research design which takes “conversation” from its genuine personalised dyadic environment to a model of a conversational agent. It allows for an informal functional specification of such an agent to which a technical specification for two specific repair types is provided.\nStarting with the open research objective to create a machine that behaves like a language expert in an informal conversation, this research shows that various forms of orientation to linguistic identities are on participants’ disposal in chat. In addition it shows that dealing with computational complexity can be approached by a separation between local models of specific practices and a high-level regulatory mechanism to activate them. More specif- ically, this work shows that learners’ repair initiations may be analysed as turn formats containing resources for signalling trouble and referencing trouble source. Based on this finding, this work shows how computational models for recognition of the repair initiations and trouble source extraction can be formalised and implemented in a chatbot. Further, this work makes clear which level of description of error corrections is required to satisfy com- putational needs, and how these descriptions may be transformed to patterns for various error correction formats and which technological requirements they imply. Finally, this research shows which factors in interaction influence the decision to correct and how the creation of a high-level decision model for error correction in a Conversation-for-Learning can be approached.\nIn sum, this research enriches the landscape of various communication setups between language learners and communicative ICALL systems explicitly covering Conversations- for-Learning. It strengthens multidisciplinary connections by showing how the multidis- ciplinary research field of ICALL benefits from including Conversation Analysis into the research paradigm. It highlights the impact of the micro-analytic understanding of actions accomplished by utterances in talk within a specific speech exchange system on computa- tional modelling on the example of chat with language learners.",

		"abstract": "The provision of automatic systems that can provide con- versational practice for beginners would make a valuable addi- tion to existing aids for foreign language teaching. To achieve this goal, the SCILL (Spoken Conversational Interaction for Language Learning) project is developing a spoken dialogue system that is capable of maintaining interactive dialogues with non-native students in the target language. However, the ef- fective realisation of the intelligent language understanding and dialogue management needed for such a system, requires robust recognition of poorly articulated non-native speech. This paper studies several popular techniques for robust acoustic modelling including HLDA, MAP and CMLLR on non-native speech data within a specific dialogue domain. In addition, a novel ap- proach for using cross language speech data to adapt the acous- tic models is described and shown to be useful when very lim- ited non-native adaptation data is available. The experimental results provide a clear story of how to improve recognition per- formance on non-native speech for a specific task, and this will be of interest more generally for those developing multi-lingual spoken dialogue systems.",

		"abstract": "An increasing amount of research is being conducted to determine how a robot tutor should behave socially in educa- tional interactions with children. Both human-human and human- robot interaction literature predicts an increase in learning with increased social availability of a tutor, where social availability has verbal and nonverbal components. Prior work has shown that greater availability in the nonverbal behaviour of a robot tutor has a positive impact on child learning. This paper presents a study with 67 children to explore how social aspects of a tutor robot’s speech influences their perception of the robot and their language learning in an interaction. Children perceive the difference in social behaviour between ‘low’ and ‘high’ verbal availability conditions, and improve significantly between a pre- and a post-test in both conditions. A longer-term retention test taken the following week showed that the children had retained almost all of the information they had learnt. However, learning was not affected by which of the robot behaviours they had been exposed to. It is suggested that in this short-term interaction context, additional effort in developing social aspects of a robot’s verbal behaviour may not return the desired positive impact on learning gains.",

The L2TOR project will capitalise on recent observations in which social robots have been shown to have marked benefits over screen-based technologies in education, both in terms of learning outcomes and motivation. As language acquisition benefits from early, personalised and interactive tutoring, current language tutoring delivery is often ill-equipped to deal with this: classroom resources are at present inadequate to offer one-to-one tutoring with (near) native speakers in educational and home contexts. L2TOR will address this by furthering the science and technology of language tutoring robots. This document describes the main research strands and expected outcomes of the project.",

In this perspective article, we propose a number of design features to develop a child-friendly social robot that can effectively support children in second language learning, and we discuss some technical challenges for developing these. The features we propose include choices to develop the robot such that it can act as a peer to motivate the child during second language learning and build trust at the same time, while still being more knowledgeable than the child and scaffolding that knowledge in adult-like manner. We also believe that the first impressions children have about robots are crucial for them to build trust and common ground, which would support child-robot interactions in the long term. We therefore propose a strategy to introduce the robot in a safe way to toddlers. Other features relate to the ability to adapt to individual children’s language proficiency, respond contingently, both temporally and semantically, establish joint attention, use meaningful gestures, provide effective feedback and monitor children’s learning progress. Technical challenges we observe include automatic speech recognition (ASR) for children, reliable object recognition to facilitate semantic contingency and establishing joint attention, and developing human-like gestures with a robot that does not have the same morphology humans have. We briefly discuss an experiment in which we investigate how children respond to different forms of feedback the robot can give.",

Two user groups were involved: three children aged 9 – 14 with extensive experience of speech training with therapists and computers, and three children aged 6, with little or no prior experience of computer-based speech training. All children had general language disorders. The study indicates that the present interface is usable without prior training or instructions, even for the younger children, but that more motivational factors should be introduced. The granularity of the mesh that classifies mispronunciations was satisfactory, but the flexibility and level of detail of the feedback should be developed further.",

We argue that language proficiency can best be achieved through active communication, and that the computer is very patient and provides a non-threatening environment in which to practice. We have adapted our pre-existing multilingual dialogue systems for this application, focusing in our initial prototype on an English-speaking student learning Mandarin within the weather domain. Two significant new contributions are a Web-based interface for practice exercises to gain proficiency in carrying out a live conversation and a high-quality narrow-domain speech translation capability. In an evaluation on 695 spoken utterances drawn from a corpus of English weather data, our translation system produces an incorrect result less than 2% of the time, with a rejection rate of 8%.",

With this work we contribute to the ongoing debate of whether, when and how virtual agents or robots provide more benefits to the user and conducted an experimental study on linguistic alignment processes in HCI in the context of second language acquisition. In our study (n = 130 non-native speakers) we explored the influence of design characteristics and investigated the influence of embodiment (virtual agent vs. robot vs. speech based interaction) and system voice (text-to-speech vs. pre-recorded speech) on participants’ perception of the system, their motivation, their lexical and syntactical alignment during interaction and their learning effect after the interaction. The variation of system characteristics had no influence on the evaluation of the system or participants’ alignment behavior.",

Our method uses a linear classifier trained with three types of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores. The three BLEU scores are calculated respectively, referring to three subsets of a learner corpus divided according to the quality of sentences. Our method classifies learner utterances into three classes (correct, acceptable with some modifications and out-of-the-scope of assumed erroneous sentences), since it is suitable for providing effective feedback. Experimental results showed that our proposed classification method could distinguish utterance acceptability with 75.8 % accuracy.",

		"abstract": "This study investigates the effects of voice chat on Korean EFL learners’ speaking ability according to their proficiency levels. With the purpose of the study, 181 college students in Korea were recruited to participate in an English speaking program that was designed to assist their speaking ability development. Participants were divided into three proficiency levels: beginning-level, intermediate-level, and advanced-level. They were then further divided into three voice chat conditions: voice chat with peers, voice chat with chatbots, and control. During the sixteen weeks of the experiment, the participants were asked to engage in one of the different types of voice chat. Before and after the actual experiment, they were required to take pre- and post-tests based on TOEIC Speaking Test by ETS. The study found positive improvements in speaking ability for the participants at all proficiency levels as a result of participating in voice chat. All the participants demonstrated statistically significant speaking ability improvement across the different chat conditions. Furthermore, all the participants at different proficiency levels showed more positive perceptions of English language learning after engaging in voice chat. It can be suggested that voice chat provides EFL learners with ample opportunities to practice speaking, reduces negative feelings and develops positive perceptions of English language learning, and consequently, improves their speaking skills.",

The proposed architecture integrates virtual environments into the Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning. This architecture supports visual, auditory, and haptic channels of interaction. It allows pedagogical ideas about language skills to be implemented and validated with a minimum design time. Moreover, we design a computational model to evaluate learner's proficiency level, and an automatic adaptation mechanism which adjusts to the learner's learning curve. We have implemented two scenarios based on the proposed architecture to teach learners how to communicate in public places such as airports and TV stores. Inputs to this system include learner's speech and hand motion, and outputs include graphical scenes, force feedback, and speech by a few embodied agents. Throughout interactions, agents discover the proficiency level of the learner and customize the level of communication complexity accordingly. The system is tested on 10 subjects. Experimental results show 14% increase in the number of proper replies, 3% decrease in grammatical errors, 16% decrease in pronunciation duration, and 11% increase in learners' proficiency level within three trials.",

		"abstract": "We describe Open CALL-SLT, an easy-to-use infrastructure for building speech-enabled online CALL courses designed to help beginner/low intermediate language students improve their spoken language skills. A course consists of a set of lessons, where a lesson takes the form of a short interactive dialogue between the system and the student; typically these dialogues will be organized around a theme like “buying a train ticket” or “checking into a hotel” At each turn, the system prompts the student with a multimedia file and a piece of text in the L1. For example, in an English-for-German-speakers course, the multimedia file might show a ticket clerk saying “How may I help you?”, and the L1 text might say “Frag : 2 Tickets nach London”. The student gives a spoken response in the L2, e.g. here “I would like two tickets to London”, which is processed using a speech recognizer and either accepted or rejected. The student will normally be able to answer in several different ways; the relationship between prompts and possible responses is defined using a minimal formalism based on regular expressions and templates. A script, written in a simple XML-based language, determines the next step in the dialogue. The formalisms used to specify prompts, responses and scripts are described in (Rayner et al 2014). The infrastructure has been thoroughly tested in a series of evaluations with 12-14 year old Swiss German students of English, which have so far involved about 100 students and produced about 13000 logged interactions (Baur et al 2013, 2014).\n\nPrevious work has all been organized around courses written by members of the development team. In the present paper, we describe how we have opened up the CALL-SLT platform so that external users can design and run their own interactive courses. Online documentation, including a tutorial organized around a simple example course, explains the process. Users upload course material to their private directory using an FTP client and compile it remotely through a web interface; when the course compiles correctly, they can then deploy it live on a server and test it over a web connection. The only equipment required is a laptop running a broadband internet connection and a headset. \n\nThe “Open” version of the system is currently in alpha testing. We describe user reactions and two sample courses written by external users. One is designed to help French-speaking university-level students improve their command of academic English vocabulary; the other teaches English-speaking people resident in Geneva how to make simple calls to the local police to report nuisances.",

The system has beendeveloped to the level of a mature prototype, freely deployed on theweb, with versions for several languages. We present an overview ofthe core system architecture and the various types of content we havedeveloped. Finally, we describe several evaluations, the last of whichis a study carried out over about a week using 130 subjects recruitedthrough the Amazon Mechanical Turk, in which CALL-SLT was contrastedagainst a control version where the speech recognition component wasdisabled. The improvement in student learning performance between thetwo groups was significant at p < 0.02.",

		"abstract": "Using speech recognition to create virtual dialogues is now possible, although it is still difficult to build real conversation partners. In this context, the CALL-SLT system developed by the University of Geneva offers a platform to create virtual dialogues with an avatar on the Web (http://callslt.unige.ch/). In this type of game, the student participates in a virtual dialogue by translating and properly verbalizing a speech act (a conceptual proposal that is not syntactic) provided in their native language. In order to provide a more immersive learning situation, we proposed an adaptation of the CALL-SLT system which does not use the learner’s native language. In this paper we describe how we used this tool in the context of a real French foreign language (FFL) training for employees of French companies. For exploratory purposes, 10 adult learners of FFL through distance learning were given access to the tool. We collected audio and usage data, as well as reports of interviews with the participants and their trainer. In the paper, we will summarize all the results. These are very encouraging but show, amongst other things, that the interaction and the relationship with a virtual conversation partner is not entirely straightforward for adult learners.",

The chatbot was designed to reflect the Socratic inquiry method based on Eliza, a computer program developed for psychotherapy. Two case studies were conducted, and 130 university students (Case 1: n=63; Case 2: n=67) were divided into experimental and control groups and observed. Case 1 served as the pilot study and focused on the effects of a chatbot conversation on the discussion; the critical thinking, satisfaction, and number of conversations in experimental and control groups were analyzed. Case 2 examined the difference in critical thinking pre- and post-discussion in both groups. Case 1 showed that a preceding conversation with a chatbot might lead to an increase in the number of contributions that students made to conversations and could increase the number of conversations in which the students participated. Case 2 results showed that pre-discussion with a chatbot could increase the students’ awareness of critical thinking and enable them to form inquiring mindsets.",

An utterance disambiguation algorithm selects the best interpretation, performing error correction as a side-effect. 1",

Four trainers have been developed so far, for Iraqi Arabic, Pashto, French and Levantine Arabic. The Tactical Iraqi system has been used to train thousands of users in the U.S. military. In this paper, we describe recent work we undertook to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the process of authoring new content for our system. The first improvement is the introduction of utterance templates, which combine two previously separate components of the system (ASR grammar specification, and user input mapping), and improve system flexibility. Secondly, we consolidated the knowledge into centrally managed object libraries in order to enable scaling up to more complex and extensive lesson content. Finally, we created dedicated object editors to facilitate lesson authoring and simplify the production of authored content into a running system.",

		"abstract": "This study examines the effect of oral practice via computer-delivered structured tasks (CASTs) with native speaker (NS) models and open-ended tasks without NS input (i.e., learner-leaner role-plays) on pragmatic development of second language learners. While prior studies have indicated that structured tasks afford more opportunities for focus on form (FonF) than open-ended tasks (Lee and VanPatten 2003; Lyster 2004; Ranta and Lyster 2007; Skehan and Foster 1999; Tavakoli and Foster 2011), differences between these tasks in prag- matic instruction (PI) have not been examined. Additionally, the effect of prac- tice has been widely examined with regard to oral development, but much less so for pragmatics (e.g., Li 2013; Takimoto 2012a). In this study, one group of ESL learners practiced request speech acts via CASTs, and another group did so via learner-learner open role-plays. Qualitative analysis of participants’ output dur- ing practice suggests that rehearsal via CASTs promotes FonF and incorporation of NS models into learners’ speech, while rehearsal via role-plays results in more creative, but often pragmatically inappropriate, language and content. Additionally, role-plays, but not CASTs, appear to be conducive to humorous language play, metapragmatic discussions, and extended turns similar to those in naturalistic interactions. The study offers insights regarding task types in PI.",

		"abstract": "3D virtual worlds are promising for immersive learning in English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Unlike English as a Second Language (ESL), EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries, and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important, in most EFL courses at the college level, EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies, grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study, an immersive English learning environment in a 3D virtual world, OpenSimulator, was developed with two key learning artifacts, chatbot and time machine. A single-factor, independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts (VE), virtual learning environment with chatbot (VEC), virtual learning environment with time machine (VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine (VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds.",

		"abstract": "Educational content developers, including AIED developers, traditionally make a distinction between formative evaluation and summative evaluation of learning materials. Although the distinction is valid, it is inadequate for many AIED systems because they require multiple types of evaluation and multiple stages of evaluation. Developers of interactive intelligent learning environments must evaluate the effectiveness of the component technologies, the quality of the user interaction, and the potential of the program to achieve learning outcomes, in order to uncover problems prior to summative evaluation. Often these intermediate evaluations go unreported, so other developers cannot benefit from the lessons learned. This paper documents the iterative evaluation of the Tactical Language Training System, an interactive game for learning foreign language and culture. This project employs a highly iterative development and evaluation cycle. The courseware and software have already undergone six discrete stages of formative evaluation, and further formative evaluations are planned. The paper documents the evaluations that were taken at each stage, as well as the information obtained, and draws lessons that may be applicable to other AIED systems.",

The system consists of automatic speech recognition, semantic/grammar correction evaluation, and tutoring module. The speech recognition is optimized for non-natives as well as natives for educational purpose and smooth interaction. Semantic/grammar correction evaluation evaluates whether the non-native learner's utterance is appropriate semantically and is correct grammatically. Tutoring module decides to go to the next turn or ask the learner to try again, and also provides a turn-by-turn corrective feedback using evaluation results. We constructed English learning service consisting of three stages such as Pronunciation Clinic, Think&Talk and Look&Talk using the system.",

		"abstract": "LanguageLand is a multimodal conversational spoken language learning system whose purpose is to help native English users learn Mandarin Chinese. The system is centered on a game that involves navigation on a simulated map. It consists of an edit and play mode. In edit mode, users can set up the street map with whichever objects (such as a house, a church, a policeman) they see in the toolbar. This can be done through spoken conversation over the telephone or typed text along with mouse clicks. In play mode, users are given a start and end corner and the goal is to get from the start to the end on the map. While the system only responds actively to accurate Mandarin phrases, the user can speak or type in English to obtain Mandarin translations of those English words or phrases. The LanguageLand application is built using Java and Swing. The overall system is constructed using the Galaxy Communicator architecture and existing SLS technologies including Summit for speech recognition, Tina for NL understanding, Genesis for NL generation, and Envoice for speech synthesis.",

		"abstract": "In the domain of language acquisition, PILÉFACE is a system that has been initially designed to take into account the pragmatic aspects of language, i.e. to provide the learner not only with a linguistic competence, but also with a communica- tive competence. That communicative competence implies that the language learner master certain pragmatic usage rules, which are mastered by the native speaker, but unspoken and unwritten, and therefore implicit. In that context, PILÉFACE is readily equipped to take into account many socio-cultural aspects of communication exchanges. In this paper, starting with culture-aware pedagogical dialogues, we show which types of cultural aspects may occur in such dialogues, how these cultural aspects are actually implemented in the data organization and system architecture of PILÉFACE, and how they could be extended using the same architecture.",

Through this approach, markers can be established between the parameters given to describe the situation and the linguistic realization translating the communication intention. This approach also promotes mechanization of usage rules and thus simulation of the intuitive reasoning process of the native speaker. Finally, the PILÉFACE system is presented, which partly implements this approach. PILÉFACE is an acronym that, translated from French, means \"Intelligent Program for Foreign Languages Fostering the Communicative Approach to Teaching.\"",

It is intended to help people who may not be cultural specialists to quickly develop the cultural skills they need to be effective in intercultural settings. This includes the knowledge and skills necessary to handle common situations involving intercultural interactions, as well as the adaptability needed to cope with unexpected intercultural interactions. Crucially, it utilizes simulations of intercultural encounters that learners are likely to experience in the course of carrying out their jobs or missions, which help learners develop the skills and confidence necessary to be effective in those situations. The approach also supports the assessment of cultural competence by testing trainees in simulated intercultural encounters. The approach makes use of a number of innovative technologies, but most importantly immersive game and artificial intelligence technologies.",

For this study we used CALL-SLT, a speech-enabled online CALL tool for beginner learners of English. The content consisted of 8 interactive and dialogue-based lessons that were based on an English textbook commonly used in German-speaking Switzerland. The lessons are designed to help students practise their productive and receptive skills in a non-judgmental environment, where simple feedback (correct vs. incorrect) is provided in real-time by the computer. The tool was used in four secondary school classes (approx. 50 active users) all across German-speaking Switzerland for a duration of four weeks each. The experiment setup also required the students to take a placement test at the beginning and at the end of the experiment phase and to fill in a questionnaire on personal background at the beginning, as well as a qualitative feedback questionnaire at the end of the experiment. We examined three specific aspects with regard to their influence on motivation: (1) the influence of gamification elements, such as scores and performance-linked badges, (2) the influence of the exercises’ difficulty and (3) aspects of students’ personal background.",

In particular, we argue that our previous evaluations have been systematically flawed due to the lack of a control group. We present a detailed description of our most recent evaluation, where 130 subjects, recruited using crowdsourcing methods, followed a short course in basic French over a period of one week, with 24 subjects completing the course. About a third of the subjects (half of the ones that finished) were assigned to a control group who used a version of the system with speech recognition feedback disabled; subjects in both groups demonstrated significant improvements in language skills over the duration of the experiment, but the improvements were significantly larger for the noncontrol subjects. We argue in conclusion that this type of experiment opens up interesting new ways to attack the difficult problem of performing controlled experiments with CALL applications.",

Besides entertaining its players, Bot Colony is also intended to help some of them learn English in a new, fun way - by playing a video game. A player’s utterance – in unrestricted, free-form English - is processed by a dialogue pipeline where it is parsed, disambiguated, co-referenced resolved, and reasoned upon, following which an answer is generated. This paper describes the dialog functionality available in the Beta version of Bot Colony, and discusses the applications of intelligent interactive conversation in video games. Some advances in automated knowledge acquisition, entailment of dictionary definitions, paraphrase, co-reference resolution to 3D scenes, spatial relations, and using natural language to program 3D animation – enabling user-generated content - are presented. The paper is based on results of our R&D work on language/AI and 3D graphics, and the interaction between them.",

		"abstract": "Increasingly, SLA research is exploring models of hybrid learning where computers are used not only as tools for information and communication purposes but as autonomous electronic tutors. Incipient evidence has shown that e-tutors can facilitate L2 grammar development and even supersede other instructional technologies (e.g., Nagata, 1996; Nutta, 1998; Watts, 1989). However, very few theoretical arguments have been presented to explicate these findings. Quite possibly, the edge of e-tutors may arise from their ability to engage learners in interactive practice (Nagata, 1996), while other multimedia technologies may only, at best, showcase pre-recorded interactions. According to the Interaction Hypothesis (Long, 1996), participation in interactive practice can promote SLA because it allows learners to notice, comprehend, and process input, produce output, form and revise hypotheses in response to feedback, and produce modified output, processes which have been shown to be developmentally helpful (Mackey, 2007). However, the IH does not specify whether or not the effects of these processes are determined by the type of agency of the learner; that is, whether it is necessary for learners to engage proactively in the aforementioned processes, or whether mere exposure to interactive practice by others (by e.g., watching a video) may suffice. On this note, existing empirical research is scant and contradictory, with Mackey (1999) showing a benefit for practice over exposure to it, Muranoi (2000) showing no significant differences, and Hsieh (2007) yielding mixed results.\n\nArguably, the relative effects of learner's agency may be moderated by the type of practice that is being performed or observed. One usual component of practice is corrective feedback, since its presence or absence draws the line between tasks for learning and testing purposes (Loschky & Bley-Vroman, 1993). Hitherto, the facilitative effects of feedback have been largely validated (Li, 2010; Lyster & Saito, 2010; Russell & Spada, 2006). However, there is no consensus as to which type of feedback yields the largest effects. These conflicting findings may be explicated by an insufficient isolation of three components of feedback, i.e., positive evidence, negative evidence, and prompting for error repair, so research must address whether they make separate contributions to L2 grammar development (Leeman, 2002; McDonough, 2005). In the realm of CALI this issue remains unaddressed, and additionally, no study to date has explored the potential of oral (as opposed to written) feedback, thus under-exploiting the potential of computers to simulate authentic communication (Warschauer, 2004).\n\nFinally, the effects of both practice and feedback may be mediated by the type of grammatical form under instruction. However, while several studies have corroborated this, there is little research on how the difficulty of a form exerts its mediating role (DeKeyser, 2007; Ellis, 2007).\n\nUsing an innovative e-tutor and a pre-test/post-test/delayed post-test design, this study empirically investigated whether intermediate-level university students of L2 Spanish (N=127) learned more grammar when given opportunities to practice or when given audiovisual exposure to others' practice. Some engaged in computer-simulated conversations with pre-filmed real people, whereas others observed videos of those interactions. The second variable under investigation was the type of corrective feedback provided, which varied in terms of the explicitness of the negative evidence (whether the error was merely spotted or explained) and the requests for error repair (whether or not students were prompted to reformulate their ill-formed productions). The effects of agency and feedback were investigated on two different grammatical forms varying in complexity, Spanish prepositional relative clauses (easier) and present subjunctive (harder). An exit questionnaire was administered to tap into participants' perceptions of the learning experience. Results showed that practice had beneficial effects over exposure to it only under more demanding conditions (less explicit feedback) and for one of the targeted structures (prepositional relative clauses). In terms of feedback, prompting yielded no significant effects, while the explicitness of negative evidence did, with more explicit feedback yielding better results for both structures. However, these effects were more evident for the easier form, prepositional relative clauses. In terms of learners' perceptions, performers were significantly more satisfied than observers, and explicit feedback generated opposite reactions. From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the growing SLA literature on the effects of practice and feedback, while from a pedagogical perspective they prove that computerized oral feedback can work, and help to elucidate precisely when computers may have an edge over non-interactive audiovisual media.",

With the development of the field of computer-assisted language learning (CALL), we have seen that computer- delivered tasks have also gradually evolved from behavioristic “drill and kill” e-tutors to more carefully designed psycholinguistics-based e-tutors and sophisticated videogames and simulations that use authentic tasks. While there are clear criteria that help distinguish whether a pedagogical activity is more “task-like” or more “exercise-like,” (cf. Ellis, 2003 & 2009), the question that stands is: can stand-alone, task-like CALL resources promote second language (L2) development without sacrificing the methodological principles stipulated by TBLT? The description of two separate CALL resources: Talking to Avatars (Cerezo, 2010) and The Maze Game (Leow, 2015), will help us answer this question.",

Developers of Spoken Language Dialogue Systems should involve users from the outset, particularly if the aim is to develop novel solutions for a generic target application area or market. As well as target end-users, SLDS developers should identify and consult \"meta-level\" domain experts with expertise in human-to-human dialogue in the target domain. In our case, English language teachers and publishers provided generic knowledge of learners' dialogue preferences; other applications have analogous domain language experts. These domain language experts can help to pin down a domain-specific sublanguage which ts the constraints of current speech recognition technology: linguistically-naive end-users may expect unconstrained conversational English, but in practice dialogue interactions have to be constrained in vocabulary and syntax. User consultation also highlighted a need to consider how to integrate speech input and output with other modes of interaction and processing; in our case the input speech signal is processed by speech recogniser, stress and mispronunciation detectors, and output responses are text and graphics as well as speech. This suggests a need to revisit the definition of \"dialogue\": other SLDS developers should also consider the merits of multimodality as an adjunct to pure spoken dialogue, particularly given that current systems are not capable of accurately handling unconstrained English.",

In common with similar platforms, like WAMI and the Nuance Mobile Developer Platform, we use a client/server approach in which speech recognition is carried out on the server side; our architecture, however, differs from these systems in offering considerably more elaborate server-side functionality, based on large-scale grammar-based language processing and generic dialogue management. We describe two substantial applications, built using our framework, which we argue would have been hard to construct in WAMI or NMDP. Finally, we present a series of evaluations carried out using CALL-SLT, a speech translation game, where we contrast performance in Web and desktop versions. Task Error Rate in the Web version is only slightly inferior that in the desktop one, and the average additional latency is under half a second. The software is generally available for research purposes.",

		"abstract": "The goal of this thesis is to explore how foreign language learning can be facilitated through the use of intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) based on natural language processing (NLP) methods. ICALL was provided in the form of a task-based dialog system that gives corrective feedback. We investigated how different parameters of the interaction affect the learning progress. Based on a comprehensive review of existing comparable ICALL applications and the underlying methods and technology, we selected parameters linked to the sophistication and effort required to implement a particular form of interaction and related them to parameters that are based on two much debated issues from the field of second language acquisition (SLA). One is the debate that pits form against meaning and leads to a discussion of the extent to which language instruction should focus on linguistic forms and formal correctness as opposed to emphasizing communicative skills and the ability to use the language to make meaning in the real world. Related to that is the second controversial issue which concerns the dichotomy between implicit and explicit knowledge, learning and instruction: How explicit or implicit should instruction be, how does the degree of explicitness affect the development of explicit and implicit knowledge, and how do these two types of knowledge contribute to language skills?\nThese two general issues are condensed into three different experimental condi- tions, that differ with regard to how much they constrain the learner input and how explicit the feedback is. More precisely, we compare strictly form-focused activities where the learner input is constrained to supply a grammatical target form with ge- nerally unconstrained participation in a meaning-oriented task-based dialog. For the latter, we further compare recast and metalinguistic feedback as implicit and expli- cit types of feedback respectively. The findings of this study indicate that there are small differences in the language skill development afforded by different types of computer-provided instruction. We find that constrained, explicit form-oriented in- struction yields in general greater immediate learning gains, while the free, more im- plicit and meaning-oriented instruction yields more delayed effects. Similarly, com- paring implicit recast feedback with explicit metalinguistic feedback we find that the immediate effects are on par but recast feedback leads to greater delayed effects. The- se differences interact considerably with other parameters of the experimental setting, in particular with the selected target structures. This suggests that the effectiveness of certain types of instruction is highly dependent on the particular content and goal of the instruction.\nBy using current SLA issues as motivation and guide to develop an ICALL system and an experimental framework this work contributes to the yet small field of existing research and development which integrates ICALL and SLA perspectives.",

We argue that it is important for language students to have the opportunity to practice communication in a non-threatening environment, something that a computer can naturally provide. We envision a three-stage interaction focused around a specific topic of a lesson plan. The first stage would familiarize the student with the vocabulary and syntax by presenting simulated dialogues at a Web page. The second stage would involve spoken dialogue interaction with the computer, either at a workstation or on the telephone. The third stage would provide feedback to the user on the quality of the utterances they recorded during the dialogue exchange. We have thus far concentrated on Mandarin and English as the two languages, where the system can be configured reversibly to support either learning English or Mandarin. We have begun to develop dialogue interaction capabilities for a number of domains centered around the scenario of a traveler to a foreign city. 1",

Unfortunately, opportunities to talk with natives, particularly for extended periods of time, are rare for the majority of language students. Multimedia and speech recognition technologies, in concert, offer an exciting solution to this problem. The researchers at Interactive Drama Inc. (IDI) have adapted their speech-activated multimedia system (Conversim™) for foreign language training. The resulting model allows students to engage native speakers on CD-ROM in lengthy, face-to-face dialogues using natural spoken language. Four Virtual Conversations™ programs have been developed to comprise a series in Arabic.1 The series was rigorously tested by IDI under a contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and in association with the Defense Language Institute and the U.S. Army Research Institute. This article describes the development of this series, the experiments that measured its use and effectiveness in a formal language training environment, and the significant findings of the research.",

Recently there have been various educational applications or tools for adult second language education, where the learning target is the acquisition of formal knowledge of a language. When considering the implementation of a practical CAI system, methods for developing communicative competence in learners are required. Although there are a number of ICAI systems for conversation learning, often the methodologies which they apply are not completely suitable for the acquisition of the required fundamental knowledge. Our system, based on the architecture of environmental CAI, enhances communication skill acquisition. The system has a learning environment with the following features: (1) A simulation of language activities, implemented in the role-playing game style, which helps to promote a learner's motivation. (2) Educational behavior of the system is varied through the modification of the learning environment and changes in the simulation progress and control commands. (3) An induction strategy, which can cause learners to fail to achieve a learning target, is executed by an advisor mechanism. The system is a prototype architecture for application in environmental ICAI systems for simulation based learning. We believe that the architecture of this system is an efficient framework for linguistic education.",

The approach is based on the premise that a common semantic representation can be extracted from the input for all languages, at least within the context of restricted domains. In the design of such systems, language dependent information is separated from the system kernel as much as possible, and encoded in external data structures. The internal system manager, discourse and dialogue component, and database are all maintained in a language transparent form. They describe two possible application areas for such multilingual capabilities: on-line information access using multilingual spoken dialogue, and the learning and maintenance of a foreign language using a multilingual conversational system",

In this paper, we introduce the immersive interaction scenario offered by spoken dialogues to CAPT by proposing a recursive dialogue game to make CAPT personalized. A number of tree-structured sub-dialogues are linked sequentially and recursively as the script for the game. The system policy at each dialogue turn is to select in real-time along the dialogue the best training sentence for each specific individual learner within the dialogue script, considering the learner's learning status and the future possible dialogue paths in the script, such that the learner can have the scores for all pronunciation units considered reaching a predefined standard in a minimum number of turns. The purpose here is that those pronunciation units poorly produced by the specific learner can be offered with more practice opportunities in the future sentences along the dialogue, which enables the learner to improve the pronunciation without having to repeat the same training sentences many times. This makes the learning process for each learner completely personalized. The dialogue policy is modeled by Markov decision process (MDP) with high-dimensional continuous state space, and trained with fitted value iteration using a huge number of simulated learners. These simulated leaners have the behavior similar to real learners, and were generated from a corpus of real learner data. The experiments demonstrated very promising results and a real cloud-based system is also successfully implemented.",

There are several types of CALL system, we focus on a spoken dialogue system for dialogue practice. When the user makes an answer to the system’s utterance, timing of making the answer utterance could be unnatural because the system usually does not make any reaction when the user keeps silence, and therefore the learner tends to take more time to make an answer to the system than that to the human counterpart. However, there is no framework to suppress the pause and practice an appropriate pause duration.\nIn this research, we did an experiment to investigate the effect of presence of the AR character to analyze the effect of character as a counterpart itself. In addition, we analyzed the pause between the two person’s utterances (switching pause). The switching pause is related to the smoothness of its conversation. Moreover, we introduced a virtual character realized by AR (Augmented Reality) as a counterpart of the dialogue to control the switching pause. Here, we installed the character the behavior of “time pressure” to prevent the learner taking long time to consider the utterance.\nTo verify if the expression is effective for controlling switching pause, we designed an experiment. The experiment was conducted with or without the expression. Consequently, we found that the switching pause duration became significantly shorter when the agent made the time-pressure expression.",

This paper first analyzes the semantic relations between learner’s mother language and target language. Then proposes a CGM (Communicative Gap Model) due to language difference. We have developed a communicative language-learning environment called Neckle (Network-based Communicative Kanji Learning Environment) to support foreign language learning through communication with native speakers. Neckle has a software agent that observes the conversation between the learner and the native speaker, checks up the communicative gap according to CGM, and notices the gap for the support of language learning congenial to each learner. Learners can not only be aware of the language difference but also acquire its cultural background from the native speakers.",

These techniques include two consecutive stages: the generation of correction candidates and the selection of correction candidates. In this study, a Context-Dependent Syllable Cluster (CD-SC)-based Confusion Matrix is proposed for the generation of correction candidates. A Contextual Fitness Score, measuring the sequential relationship to the neighbors of the candidate, is proposed for corrected syllable sequence selection. Finally, the n-gram language model is used to determine the final word sequence output. Experiments show that the proposed method improved from 0.742 to 0.771 in terms of BLEU score as compared to the conventional speech recognition mechanism.",

Our approach consists in rejecting the “classic” linguistic evaluations (such as multiple choice questionnaires) in order to imple- ment a communicative approach to language learning. A Wizard of Oz study reveals this approach is promising. The system is not implemented yet, but its architecture is based on several implemented systems, in particular on a dia- logue model we have developed within the framework of other projects concerning Human-Computer Dialogue.",

		"abstract": "Researchers and practitioners in the field of language instruction largely agree today that proficiency in a foreign language requires more than grammatical competence: it requires a kind of know-how they call \"communicative competence\", of which grammatical competence is but a subset. The present paper claims that, although this view of language learning has been prominent for over a generation (Hymes seminal paper \"On communicative competence\" dates back to 1966), it has had little impact on Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) projects. Indeed, CALL systems regularly use the most recent and technologically advanced hardware/software resources to implement the most out-dated grammar-based pedagogy; thus, the total instructional value of such systems is undercut by the very didactics they (often quite ingeniously) embody. In the present paper, a case is made for \"Conversation Rebuilding\", a recent trend in \"communicative teaching\" that has been implemented in a text-based CALL system built around a Common LISP Artificial Intelligence engine on a MacIntosh platform. It is argued that a system of this kind is likely to give more instructional value than systems using more sophisticated interfaces or architectures but which embody more traditional language-teaching methods.",

Students in post-industrial societies now require a “cultural communicative” approach, based on treating speech as “historical will” and on introjecting the target culture’s Weltanschauung (mind-set) together with its linguistic system. In this kind of teaching, computers may be used to rehearse the classroom simulations which prepare for real-life interaction. Cultural-communicative work on the computer is perceived as non-mechanical and genuinely aids the process of interiorizing the new mind-set. A pilot CALL program, written in LISP on a MacIntosh platform, is described. It illustrates how a tested cultural-communicative classroom practice, “Conversation Rebuilding”, lends itself to a (no-frills) implementation on an ordinary PC.",

This approach contributes to a reduction both in computational processing time and complexity of the system and opens a wide door for a new natural language processing (NLP)-based dialogue system (written and spoken) of future man-machine interactive systems.",

First, the chatting activities using both the chatterbot and the messenger were effective in improving the learners' writing and speaking skills. Second, the analysis of the chatting scripts of the two different chatting tools reveals that the T-unit length had shown a gradual extension, which indicates that the learners became to produce more complicate and longer sentences. Third, some similarities and differences of langue use and patterns used by the two CMC tools were observed with respect to communicative strategies, grammatical errors, topic avoidance, self-correction, and code switching, etc. Based on the findings of the study, some practical and pedagogical suggestions are made on how to maximize the potential educational benefits of the CMC tools.",

		"abstract": "Interactive drama is increasingly being used as a pedagogical tool in a wide variety of computer-based learning environments. However, the effort required to build interactive dramas is quite significant. We built Thespian, an architecture that supports faster development of IPDs, open-ended interaction, encoding of pedagogical goals and quantitative metrics for evaluating those goals. Thespian uses autonomous agents to control each character and assumes that the starting point for the design process is a set of standard scripts. A “fitting” algorithm facilitates the design process by automatically adjusting the goals of the agents so that the agents perform their roles according to the scripts. This also ensures the agents will behave true to their character's motivations even when the interactive drama deviates from the scripts. In this paper, we discuss this basic approach in detail and illustrate its application to the Tactical Language Training System.",

The feedback types differed with respect to the focus they put on form versus meaning and the explicitness of feedback in response to learner errors. The results of the study suggest that a stronger focus on form is related to greater accuracy gains in using the form. The integration of incidental focus on form within a primarily meaning-based task increases accuracy as well, however to a lesser extent.",

The result is a self-access learning package: SPELL (Spoken Electronic Language Learning). The SPELL system has been implemented to run in real time on a standard desktop PC. A prototype of SPELL is in user testing with learners of Italian and learners of Japanese in five high schools in Scotland. The speech recogniser is programmed to recognise grammatical and some ungrammatical utterances so that the learner can receive feedback on their language production. The dialogues can be modified in cases of communication difficulties, and are reactive to the learner's spoken input so that the learner receives relevant and immediate feedback to their utterance. Feedback takes two key forms: reformulations, where the system modifies the initial input, and recasts, where the system repeats the learner's utterance, implicitly correcting any errors. The SPELL system will offer a test bed for the effectiveness of the feedback within a self-access virtual learning environment.",

		"abstract": "Modern computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users, but also in promoting learning. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games, games that have non-entertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter, the techniques employed are very different. Can AIED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques, or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS), a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling, pedagogical agents, and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world, interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties, and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.",

		"abstract": "This study compared the use of an animated pedagogical agent (agent) with an electronic arrow and voice narration (arrow and voice) in a multimedia learning environment where 74 college level English as a Second Language (ESL) students learned English relative clauses. No significant differences in learning or performance were found between the group receiving the agent and the arrow and voice group. This result provides evidence for Clark's (2001) claim that learning is supported by appropriate instructional methods (in this study directing attention to and voicing key concepts), not a delivery medium (in this study an animated agent or the drawing of an arrow with voice). Clark has also argued against using expensive instructional media when lower cost alternatives achieve the same or similar learning and motivation goals. It was also found that the agent's visual appearances and social behaviors did not motivate, interest, or tutor learners better than the simple arrow with voice. Thus, this result does not support the Persona Effect (Lester, Converse, Kahler, Barlow, Stone, & Bhogal, 1997) which is derived from the hypothesis that an animated agent motivates human-computer interaction because it is perceived as more socially engaging and interesting than other attention directing and information dispensing devices, and thus leads learners to work harder and learn more. The study also did not support the cognitive efficiency hypothesis (Cobb, 1997) which refers to one medium requiring less effort from learners in achieving a specific learning criterion or leading to faster learning than another. No significant difference was found between the agent and arrow with voice groups in the measured levels of cognitive efficiency. Yet, as in past studies, the data suggested a significant learning benefit of animated pedagogical agents for learners with the lowest levels of prior knowledge but no differences at the intermediate or advanced prior knowledge levels.",

In this paper, we propose an intelligent conversational agent and its language development mechanism by putting together five promising techniques; Bayesian networks, pattern matching, finite state machines, templates, and genetic programming. Knowledge acquisition implemented by finite state machines and templates, and language learning by genetic programming are developed for language development.

		"abstract": "This paper suggests how an advanced technology called pedagogical agents can be applied to English education to benefit learners across ages through computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and content-based language learning (CBLL). CALL, when designed appropriately, has positively influenced the development of a learner’s linguistic proficiency and communicative competence (Chun, 1994; Fotos & Browne, 2004). CBLL integrates language learning with subject-matter learning to make language learning more meaningful (Snow, 2001; Swain, 1998). However, the conventional CALL programs are often criticized for the lacking a social context, considered essential for successful language learning ( Warschauer, 2004). Also, CBLL seems rarely applied to EFL contexts, especially Korean English Education, mainly due to the lack of resources. Pedagogical agents (PAs), defined as animated life-like characters embedded in computer-based applications, might be able to overcome those constraints. Given the similarity between human/computer interaction and human-to-human interaction in the real world (Reeves & Nass, 1996), PAs can be designed to emulate social interaction and play simulated instructional roles, through which learners may find learning English engaging and relevant.

		"abstract": "We describe a computer assisted language learning (CALL) system that uses human–machine dialogue as its medium of interaction. The system was developed to help students learn the basics of the Māori language and was designed to accompany the introductory course in Māori running at the University of Otago. The student engages in a task-based conversation with the CALL system, which is designed to provide practice in specific language constructions as well as to provide opportunities to negotiate meaning within the constraints of the target language constructions. The focus of the paper is on evaluating the CALL system with students. We began with a series of observations of a small number of students using an early version of the system. These real-use observations informed the development of the system which was used in a quanititative study with a different student cohort later in the year. Learning outcomes were assessed through written tests on the Māori system of personal pronouns. Our results show that students who attended the CALL tutorials scored at least as well as students who attended regular tutorials on immediate post-tests. The CALL tutorial groups scored less well on delayed post-tests and some possible reasons for this are discussed. Some caveats for the study are also discussed along with suggestions for further research.",

		"abstract": "Most studies examining Computer Mediated Communication to enhance EFL learning have been limited to evaluating test scores, questionnaires, and interviewing students. This study used a holistic assessment model with qualitative analysis of student reflective essays and descriptive analysis of pre- and post-test oral performance by students in a university English conversation course in Taiwan. The instructional design included Internet videoconferences with a native speaker in the United States and an emphasis on critical thinking about cultural differences and similarities. Although the class was too small for statistical analysis, the students' oral scores improved an average of 44.5% from the beginning to end of the semester. The analysis of the essays showed that students engaged in reflective thinking about 70% of the items they observed in their essays, which is evidence of critical thinking. Qualitative analysis revealed four major recurring themes in the students' essays, 1) this was a different kind of class from any they have taken before and the instructional design was helpful, 2) the importance of history and underlying meaning of iconic cultural elements, such as holidays and festivals, 3) their development of a growing multicultural worldview, and 4) their growing confidence as a result of the course.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, the concept of \"autonomous mental development\" (AMD) has been applied to the construction of artificial systems such as conversational agents, in order to resolve some of the difficulties involved in the manual definition of their knowledge bases and behavioral patterns. AMD is a new paradigm for developing autonomous machines, which are adaptive and flexible to the environment. Language development, a kind of mental development, is an important aspect of intelligent conversational agents. In this paper, we propose an intelligent conversational agent and its language development mechanism by putting together five promising techniques: Bayesian networks, pattern matching, finite-state machines, templates, and genetic programming (GP). Knowledge acquisition implemented by finite-state machines and templates, and language learning by GP are used for language development. Several illustrations and usability tests show the usefulness of the proposed developmental conversational agent",

		"abstract": "Early and intermediate second language (L2) learners often encounter difficulties when engaging in introductory social conversations, typically having had little opportunity to practise such interactions. This article describes a project to design and prototype a computer dialogue system, Let's Chat, which would allow learners to rehearse social conversations without a human partner. While most existing systems do not facilitate interactions of a sufficiently high quality to be useful for L2 acquisition, Let's Chat does so by relying on communication through pre-stored phrases, thereby steering clear of the technological limitations of conventional natural language processing. This approach is supported by research that suggests that the holistic assimilation of L2 sequences can boost the communicative capabilities and fluency of learners. By practising with Let's Chat, learners would acquire good target language input in the form of well-constructed, native-like utterances and thus be better-prepared, more confident participants during natural conversations.",

However, the cost of modeling such characters, authoring and editing their interactions, and delivering them over limited-bandwidth connections can be prohibitive. This paper describes a framework, authoring tools, and Web-based run-time environment that support the creation of training scenarios using digital virtual humans and other reusable 3D components. By conforming to the Humanoid Animation (H-Anim), Extensible 3D, and ADL Shareable Content Object Reference Model specifications, these 3D components are designed to promote reuse and interoperability at several levels. Recently, these software tools were used to develop prototype lessons in foreign language and cultural familiarization for use at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center. These lessons include simulations in which the student, taking the role of a US soldier, interacts with the local population of a foreign culture in authentic situations, using both English and the local dialect. Digital virtual humans are used to represent not only the soldier, and the role-playing actors; but also a mentor who reviews language and cultural learning points, and provides remediation. Using these prototype lessons as examples, we review the potential advantages of the technology in other training applications.",

Politeness is an integral part of socially appropriate and affective conversational behaviour, e.g. consider the difference in the pragmatic effect of realizing the same communicative goal with either “Get me a glass of water mate!” or “I wonder if I could possibly have some water please?” This paper presents POLLy (Politeness for Language Learning), a system which combines a spoken language generator with an artificial intelligence planner to model Brown and Levinson’s theory of politeness in collaborative task-oriented dialogue, with the ultimate goal of providing a fun and stimulating environment for learning English as a second language. An evaluation of politeness perceptions of POLLy’s output shows that: (1) perceptions are generally consistent with Brown and Levinson’s predictions for choice of form and for discourse situation, i.e. utterances to strangers need to be much more polite than those to friends; (2) our indirect strategies which should be the politest forms, are seen as the rudest; and (3) English and Indian native speakers of English have different perceptions of politeness.",

IRC may be used with a variety of different learning algorithms, but it is particularly easily described in EC lingo. In these terms, it is a framework for automatically learning a procedure that generates a desired type of behavior, in which: a set of exemplars of the target behavior-type are utilized for fitness estimation; reinforcement signals from a human teacher are used for fitness evaluation; and the execution of candidate procedures may be modified by the teacher via corrections delivered in real-time. An example application of IRC to teach behaviors to AI-controlled artificial animals embodied in the Second Life virtual world is described in detail, including a review of the overall virtual-animal-control software architecture and how the integrative teaching/learning methodology fits into it. In this example application architecture, the learning algorithm may be toggled between hillclimbing and probabilistic evolutionary learning. Envisioned future applications are also discussed, including an application to embodied language learning applicable to agents in Second Life and other virtual worlds.",

		"abstract": "Sign languages are the native languages for many pre-lingually deaf people and must be treated as genuine natural languages worthy of academic study in their own right. For such pre-lingually deaf, whose familiarity with their local spoken language is that of a second language learner, written text is much less useful than is commonly thought. This paper presents research into sign language generation from English text at the University of East Anglia that has involved sign language grammar development to support synthesis and visual realisation of sign language by a virtual human avatar. One strand of research in the ViSiCAST and eSIGN projects has concentrated on the generation in real time of sign language performance by a virtual human (avatar) given a phonetic-level description of the required sign sequence. A second strand has explored generation of such a phonetic description from English text. The utility of the conducted research is illustrated in the context of sign language synthesis by a preliminary consideration of plurality and placement within a grammar for British Sign Language (BSL). Finally, ways in which the animation generation subsystem has been used to develop signed content on public sector Web sites are also illustrated. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

In our model, the user is one speaker, and the system ‘plays’ a number of other speakers. We present a number of principles governing dialogue management in such cases, which relate to turn-taking and the identification of the addressees of utterances. We also consider how to extend a syntactic and semantic treatment of first- and second-person personal pronouns, and of addressee terms, in order to deal with the multi-speaker scenario. We give some examples of our current system, and conclude by outlining some extensions of the system to include disagreements, interruptions, and private communication between subgroups of dialogue participants.",

Conventional computer-assisted language learning courseware hardly improves learner’s speaking skill, since it is difficult for the courseware to act as a speaking partner. In the very beginning level language learning, the number of vocabularies, grammars, idioms, and phrases are limited, and we propose a fully-automated computer-assisted language learning courseware to improve speaking skills. The proposed courseware act as a virtual human partner and learner can have conversion with it. It has pre-programmed conversation scenarios and speech database. During conversation, it recognizes learner’s speech, picks up proper response, and synthesizes artificial speech to the learner.

		"abstract": "This paper describes an attempt to automate the large-scale assessment of oral language proficiency and listening comprehension for fairly advanced students of English as a second language. The automatic test is implemented as a spoken dialogue system and consists of a reading as well as a repeating task. Two experiments are described in which different rating criteria were used by human judges. In the first experiment, proficiency was scored globally for each of the two test components. In the second experiment, various aspects of proficiency were evaluated for each section of the test. In both experiments, rate of speech (ROS), goodness of pronunciation (GOP) and repeat accuracy were calculated for the spoken utterances. The correlation between scores assigned by human raters and these three automatically derived measures was determined to assess their suitability as proficiency indicators. Results show that the more specific rating instructions used in the second experiment improved intra-rater agreement, but made little difference to inter-rater agreement. In addition, the more specific rating criteria resulted in a better correlation between the human and the automatic scores for the repeating task, but had almost no impact in the reading task. Overall, the results indicate that, even for the narrow range of proficiency levels observed in the test population, the automatically derived ROS and accuracy scores give a fair indication of oral proficiency.",

By using a sample of target users in the evaluation, it is possible to gather information on attitudes towards the program and performance of the program with an intended population. However, such users come to the research with personal attitudes towards the target language and the learning process. This article describes the evaluation of a speech-interactive CALL program that creates an environment in which the learners, using speech recognition technology, can converse with virtual characters in the target language in real time. A cross-cultural empirical evaluation was adopted where two groups of users participated in the research: students of French in Scotland and students of English as a foreign language in mainland China. The evaluations sought to investigate user attitudes towards the speech-interactive CALL program and the performance of the system. In addition, users' motivations towards studying the target language were investigated. Differences were found between the two groups of learners with regards to their motivation towards studying the target language, which may be considered in relation to their differences in attitude towards the speech interactive CALL program.",

In order to provide an interactive learning environment with some degree of automatic metaphorical understanding from open-ended text input, new developments on affect detection for the processing of several metaphorical languages have been presented. The emotional gesture and facial animation have been created for users' avatars and activated by affective states detected from users' text input. Emotion appraisal and affect detection functions have been embodied in an intelligent conversational agent, who interacts with human users for drama improvisation. We have also conducted user testing with 24 autistic children to evaluate the overall framework. The work has the potential to improve autistic young people's ability in language learning and their social connection with other people.

Despite this knowledge, many educational tools, such as vocabulary training programs, still model the interaction in a tutoring scenario as unidirectional knowledge transfer rather than a social dialog. Therefore, ongoing research aims to develop virtual agents as more appropriate media in education. Virtual agents can induce the perception of a life-like social interaction partner that communicates through natural modalities such as speech, gestures and emotional expressions. This effect can be additionally enhanced with a physical robotic embodiment. This paper presents the development of social supportive behaviors for a robotic tutor to be used in a language learning application. The effect of these behaviors on the learning performance of students was evaluated. The results support that employing social supportive behavior increases learning efficiency of students.",

These days mobile technology, with popular devices such as iPhones, Android phones, and iPads, is steering our learning environment towards increasingly focusing on mobile learning or m-Learning. Currently, most interfaces employ keyboards, mouse or touch technology, but some emerging input-interfaces use voice- or marker-based gesture recognition. In the future, one of the cutting-edge technologies likely to be used is robotics. Robots are already being used in some classrooms and are receiving an increasing level of attention. Robots today are developed for special purposes, quite similar to personal computers in their early days. However, in the future, when mass production lowers prices, robots will bring about big changes in our society. In this column, the author focuses on educational service robots. Educational service robots for language learning and robot-assisted language learning (RALL) will be introduced, and the hardware and software platforms for RALL will be explored, as well as implications for future research.",

The recent trend in the use of computer-based instruction for foreign language learning, coupled with the need for integrating social interaction into language instruction, provides a foundation for the study. Students’ learning experiences with or without a pedagogical agent were compared. Data were collected both quantitatively and qualitatively by using questionnaires and surveys. Although there were no statistical differences between the groups, findings from the survey illuminated possible explanations for the lack of statistical differences, which led to a deeper understanding of students’ learning experiences. Students who worked with pedagogical agents also showed positive reactions towards pedagogical agents that could be considered for future research. The findings from the survey also offered suggestions regarding what aspects of pedagogical agents should be kept or improved for language learning. These findings could suggest practical and theoretical implications for using pedagogical agents in foreign language education.",

		"abstract": "Virtual reality has long been used for training simulations in fields from medicine to welding to vehicular operation, but simulations involving more complex cognitive skills present new design challenges. Foreign language learning, for example, is increasingly vital in the global economy, but computer-assisted education is still in its early stages. Immersive virtual reality is a promising avenue for language learning as a way of dynamically creating believable scenes for conversational training and role-play simulation. Visual immersion alone, however, only provides a starting point. We suggest that the addition of social interactions and motivated engagement through narrative gameplay can lead to truly effective language learning in virtual environments. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel application for teaching Mandarin using CAVE-like VR, physical props, human actors and intelligent virtual agents, all within a semester-long multiplayer mystery game. Students travel (virtually) to China on a class field trip, which soon becomes complicated with intrigue and mystery surrounding the lost manuscript of an early Chinese literary classic. Virtual reality environments such as the Forbidden City and a Beijing teahouse provide the setting for learning language, cultural traditions, and social customs, as well as the discovery of clues through conversation in Mandarin with characters in the game.",

		"abstract": "Second language learning has become an important societal need over the past decades. Given that the number of language teachers is far below demand, computer-aided language learning software is becoming a promising supplement to traditional classroom learning, as well as potentially enabling new opportunities for self-learning. The use of speech technologies is especially attractive to offer students unlimited chances for speaking exercises. To create helpful and intelligent speaking exercises on a computer, it is necessary for the computer to not only recognize the acoustics, but also to understand the meaning and give appropriate responses. Nevertheless, most existing speech-enabled language learning software focuses only on speech recognition and pronunciation training. Very few have emphasized exercising the student's composition and comprehension abilities and adopting language technologies to enable free-form conversation emulating a real human tutor. This thesis investigates the critical functionalities of a computer-aided language learning system, and presents a generic framework as well as various language- and domain-independent modules to enable building complex speech-based language learning systems. Four games have been designed and implemented using the framework and the modules to demonstrate their usability and flexibility, where dynamic content creation, automatic assessment, and automatic assistance are emphasized. The four games, reading, translation, question-answering and dialogue, offer different activities with gradually increasing difficulty, and involve a wide range of language processing techniques, such as language understanding, language generation, question generation, context resolution, dialogue management and user simulation. User studies with real subjects show that the systems were well received and judged to be helpful.",

		"abstract": "Pronunciation errors may be caused by several different deviations from the target, such as voicing, intonation, insertions or deletions of segments, or that the articulators are placed incorrectly. Computer-animated pronunciation teachers could potentially provide important assistance on correcting all these types of deviations, but they have an additional benefit for articulatory errors. By making parts of the face transparent, they can show the correct position and shape of the tongue and provide audiovisual feedback on how to change erroneous articulations. Such a scenario however requires firstly that the learner's current articulation can be estimated with precision and secondly that the learner is able to imitate the articulatory changes suggested in the audiovisual feedback. This article discusses both these aspects, with one experiment on estimating the important articulatory features from a speaker through acoustic-to-articulatory inversion and one user test with a virtual pronunciation teacher, in which the articulatory changes made by seven learners who receive audiovisual feedback are monitored using ultrasound imaging.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes the evaluation of an educational game designed to give learners of foreign languages the opportunity to practice their spoken language skills. Within the speech interactive Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) program, scenarios are presented in which learners interact with virtual characters in the target language using speech recognition technology. Two types of interactive scenarios with virtual characters are presented as part of the game: the one-to-one scenarios which take the form of practice question and answer scenarios where the learner interacts with one virtual character and the interactive scenario which is an immersive contextualised scenario where the learner interacts with two or more virtual characters within the scene to complete a (task-based) communicative goal. The study presented here compares learners&#x2019; subjective attitudes towards the different scenarios. In addition, the study investigates the performance of the speech recognition component in this game. Forty-eight students of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) took part in the evaluation. Results indicate that learners&#x2019; subjective ratings for the contextualised interactive scenario are higher than for the one-to-one, practice scenarios. In addition, recognition performance was better for these interactive scenarios.",

Particularly, peer dialogue can play a vital role in intellectual development and language acquisition. Thus, we argue that the use of a conversational agent, designed to advance peer interaction and cognitive activity, would enhance learning outcomes related to language learning. In this work, we describe the design of a web-based collaborative system that utilizes a configurable conversational agent, which facilitates and triggers the learners' discussion.

		"abstract": "Although there have been enormous investments into English education all around the world, not many differences have been made to change the English instruction style. Considering the shortcomings for the current teaching-learning methodology, we have been investigating advanced computer-assisted language learning (CALL) systems. This paper aims at summarizing a set of POSTECH approaches including theories, technologies, systems, and field studies and providing relevant pointers. On top of the state-of-the-art technologies of spoken dialog system, a variety of adaptations have been applied to overcome some problems caused by numerous errors and variations naturally produced by non-native speakers. Furthermore, a number of methods have been developed for generating educational feedback that help learners develop to be proficient. Integrating these efforts resulted in intelligent educational robots – Mero and Engkey – and virtual 3D language learning games, Pomy. To verify the effects of our approaches on students' communicative abilities, we have conducted a field study at an elementary school in Korea. The results showed that our CALL approaches can be enjoyable and fruitful activities for students. Although the results of this study bring us a step closer to understanding computer-based education, more studies are needed to consolidate the findings.",

		"abstract": "Spoken words have always been an important component of traditional instruction. With the development of modern educational technology tools, spoken text more often replaces or supplements written or on-screen textual representations. However, there could be a cognitive load cost involved in this trend, as spoken words can have both benefits and disadvantages based on essential characteristics of our cognitive architecture. This paper analyzes factors that might moderate the effectiveness of using spoken text in instruction by reviewing relevant studies in multimedia learning and considering cognitive load consequences of the transiency of spoken information. However, in contrast to earlier studies that considered spoken words in the context of a specific cognitive load effect, this paper provides a framework for evaluating potential instructional benefits of spoken text by analyzing various instructional situations depending on whether spoken text is used together with pictures and written text, and taking into account relations between presented sources of information.",

The proposed model uses ranking features that consider various aspects of dialogs, including the relative importance of speech acts, dialog history sequences, and the causal relationships among speech acts and slot-filling states. The ranking algorithm enables one to aggregate these feature scores systematically and to generate diverse system responses. Additionally, the model provides detailed feedback by analyzing the causal relationships among speech acts and predicting the user's possible intentions associated with a given dialog states. Simulated experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective for task-oriented dialogs and chat-like dialogs. Additionally, a case study using elementary school students implies that the proposed system can be used for language learning purposes in addition to task-oriented services.",

These queries are performed by an optimized fuzzy search engine. Two scenarios including two virtual airports and a virtual electronic gadget shop are implemented in this architecture to improve users' oral skills.

Our research developed a courseware that supports a XML-based markup language and an authoring tool for teachers to script animated pedagogical agents in teaching materials. The design of the markup language refers to Mayer's segmenting principle that is efficient for assisting a teacher to edit teaching contents into a set of segments and further organize the segments in a given lesson in class. This paper details a case study of applying the proposed courseware for elementary students in English education, and further investigates how the instructional materials scripted using the courseware affect the learning achievement of students. Two groups of participants from an elementary school in Taiwan enrolled in this experiment. The experimental group used animated agent-based instructional materials in their English classroom, whereas the control group participated in a traditional curriculum. Post-test results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group. Our experiment demonstrated that the developed courseware provides an opportunity for scripting animated pedagogical agents as appropriate instructional tools in a computer-assisted language learning environment to foster elementary students’ English learning.",

We report results from studies that we have conducted with Billie, an IVA employed as a vocabulary trainer, as well as research findings on the acceptance of the agent as a trainer by adults and children. The results show that Billie can train humans as well as a human teacher can and that both adults and children accept the IVA as a trainer. The advantages of IVAs are multiple. First, their teaching methods can be based on neuropsychological research findings concerning memory and learning practice. Second, virtual teachers can provide individualized training. Third, they coach users during training, are always supportive, and motivate learners to train. Fourth, agents will reside in the user's mobile devices and thus be at the user's disposal everywhere and anytime. Agents in apps will make foreign language training accessible to anybody at low cost. This will enable people around the world, including physically, financially, and geographically disadvantaged persons, to learn a foreign language and help to facilitate multilingualism.",

DB-LLG is an educational game designed for language learners to convey interactive conversations with in-game characters in interactive immersive environments, such as post office, library, shops, on the street, etc. Students have meaningful interactions with Non Player Characters to complete tasks in each game mission. We used the Wizard-of-Oz method as a preliminary technique to explore various affective effects resulting from students‟ dialog behaviors during the game. A total of 10 elementary school students, ranging in age from 12 to 13, participated in the experiment. The pre/post survey questionnaires were conducted to investigate the effect of DB-LLG approach on the affective factors of learning English. The results showed that DB-LLG significantly encourages students‟ satisfaction, interest, and learnability, while slightly decreasing students‟ pre-existing confidence.",

The chatting consisted of a series of set questions/statements (determined as being in the domain of an ESL learner) – aimed at assessing the accuracy and felicity of the chatbots' answers at the grammatical level. Results indicate that chatbots are generally able to provide grammatically acceptable answers, with three chatbots returning acceptability figures in the 90% range. When meaning is factored in, however, a different picture emerges, with the chatbots often providing meaningless, nonsensical answers, and the accuracy rate for the joint categories of grammar and meaning falling below 60%. The paper concludes on the note that although chatbots as “conversation practice machines” do not yet make robust chatting partners, improvements in chatbot performance bode well for future developments.",

The analysis of regular examination scores and vocabulary test validates the positive impact of CSIEC, and in most cases, the positive impact is statistically significant. The reliability is ensured by the spectrum of the students from Grade 1 to Grade 3 in three junior high schools and from Grade 1 to Grade 2 in one senior high school, and of the teachers with or without blended learning experience, as well as by the various school locations from rural to urban areas in four provinces of China. The learning content-oriented design and the instant feedback feature of the web-based system, as well as its regular integration into the English class, contributed to its reliable positive effect on students' learning performance in ordinary examinations. This is the research's implication for instructional design. The conclusion of this paper could serve as a reference to the technical feasibility and pedagogical benefit of regular usage of appropriate Computer Assisted Learning system in the mainstream subject of middle schools. The multiple quasi-experiments in divergent school settings to ensure the results' reliability distinguish this research from previous ones that just implemented one single experiment in one school.",

Part of the project is devoted to a study of virtual lecture systems constructed in a 3D virtual space chat system. In the study, we found out that few users visited the space in non-lecture time, and some students used not their target foreign language but Japanese, their native language, after their lecture. We suppose the former comes from the absence of \"habitues\" to talk with in the space. The latter could be attributed to the absence of leaders in foreign language conversations. In order to solve these problems, we propose a tutor robot system supporting foreign language conversation both in lecture and non-lecture time. We adopt chatter bots for the tutor robots and design a base of the tutor robot system called Chat Bots Mediator. We describe the system design presenting a prototype example.",

		"abstract": "Conversational agents constitute a specific type of ITSs that has been reportedly proven successful in helping students in one-to-one settings, while recently their impact has also been explored in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). In this work, we present MentorChat, a dialogue-based system that employs a configurable and domain-independent conversational agent for triggering students’ productive dialogue. After a system overview with an emphasis on design rationale and system architecture, we present a pilot study, where the agent is evaluated in the context of the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) domain. Thirty students collaborated in small groups trying to accomplish three different tasks. MentorChat conversational agent supported each group discussion differently in each task providing (a) ‘weak’-directed interventions and/or (b) undirected interventions. The study results indicate that ‘weak’-directed agent interventions can be more effective than undirected interventions by means of increasing the level of explicit reasoning, and thus productive dialogue. Some encouraging results concerning the system usability and user acceptance are also presented.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes a series of awareness-raising activities for English language secondary school teachers-in-training -- with a view to evaluating future, that is, \"intelligent\", CALL for English language teaching. The paper first puts the development of CALL applications into perspective (after Atwell, 1999; Warschauer and Healey, 1998) in terms of its impact on ESL teachers. The paper then describes a series of activities intended to raise English language teachers' awareness and to enable them to evaluate advances in IT technology -- as these will affect ESL teaching and learning. In order to achieve this future perspective, the activities described centre around language engineering software that than current CALL software per se. The paper makes reference to the secondary education system in Hong Kong, where there has been a strong push by the government for IT to support the classroom teaching of all subjects by at least 25%. For such a policy to even begin to be achieved, and for the classroom use of IT to be appropriate and effective, two conditions need to be in place. Firstly, teachers need to be familiar with and comfortable in the use of IT -- specifically, the widening range of language engineering software. Secondly, they need to be able to evaluate the possibilities that IT offers. It is only if these two conditions are met that there is a greater chance that future use of CALL will be integrated into teaching in a worthwhile manner.",

MILT joins the strengths of previous computer-based approaches to language training with emerging technologies from the fields of computational linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering to form an innovative, interactive tutor in a Pentium-based laptop computer. The first version of MILT with keyboard input was designed for Spanish and Arabic and can recognize tens of thousands of common words and hundreds of military terms in each of these languages. Its major software engine is a natural language processor (NLP). The goal of the MILT design team was an authoring system which would require no formal external training and which could be learned within four hours by anyone familiar with the Windows environment, even someone with no programming experience, using only documentation and internal MILT help functions. In MILT-DSR(discrete speech recognition), students are given an exercise which allows them to use language production to manipulate a graphics microworld. At Fort Campbell using 5th Special Forces Group personnel a field evaluation was conducted in early June, 1997. For each evaluation, two types of data were collected: (a) student attitudes toward the tutor and (b) instructional effects of the tutor.",

The challenge of creating task conditions in a written interactive mode, in which the dynamism and immediacy of recasts can be brought to bear on L2 development, has been a formidable obstacle to advancing the exploration of written recasts. This study examines the developmental effects of recast-intensive interaction on ESL question formation and morphosyntactic accuracy. It compares the effects of recasts delivered in oral (face-to-face) tasks with recasts delivered in analogous written (computer-guided) tasks. In a pretest/posttest design, 56 high school ESL learners engaged a series of communicative tasks with either a native English speaker or an intelligent virtual interlocutor. The results indicated that participation in recast-intensive interaction was a significant predictor of both ESL question development and improvement in morphosyntactic accuracy. The mode of interaction—oral or written—had no effect on development.",

Our goal is to provide an environment that allows learners to practice language skills by interacting with other learners and artificial conversational agents using instant messaging and email. The learners take part in an adventure story and must use dialogues that are typically found in basal language textbooks to move forward in the adventure. Within the conversational agent these dialogues are modeled as dialogue games—transition networks linking the possible linguistic actions that describe the dialogue. The story moves forward from one dialogue game to another by means of a planner based on situated activity (Agre and Chapman 1988). The implemented prototype system allows three students of Spanish to take part in a magical adventure centered on the famous Mexican polyglot and heroine, La Malinche.",

However, the current foreign language instructors often adopt one-way teaching, and the learning environment lacks any interactive instructional media with which to increase the children's motivation to learn. The contribution of this paper is to create an interactive language classroom using a robot that includes the hardware arrangement, the software design and the interactive instruction process among the teacher, the students, and the robot. Additionally, we evaluated the usability of the robot for the instructional activity, and we analyzed the change in the students' behavior by using questionnaires and video recordings. Ninety-five percent of the students indicated that they enjoyed the English class more as a result of their teacher communicating through a robot. Also, the children's will to actively participate was significantly increased, through the guidance they received from the robot. This study might provide a practicable framework for educational researchers to explore or design further instructional activities with robots",

To confront this situation there is a wide variety of courses for learning Spanish. However, specific initiatives combining proven teaching methods in university classroom experiences with the creation of new multidisciplinary content displayed on 3D virtual sets have not been detected. This study proposes the establishment of a learner’s role-play to improve learner’s skills. Foreign languages’ learning is the focus of the report because can serve as an appropriate context to analyze self-directed learning strategies and the culture of Lifelong Learning. The goal of this research is the creation of an integrated Massively Multiuser Online Learning (MMOL) platform that enables the creation, development and deployment of contents and activities for teaching Spanish in an ad hoc educational virtual world named SLRoute. Such environment promotes an immersive, creative and collaborative experience in the process of learning a foreign language.

The Companion is aimed to help advanced learners of a foreign language to practice conversation via instant messenger dialogues. In order to model a meaningful long-term interaction with an Artificial Conversational Companion for this application case, it is necessary to understand how natural long-term interaction via chat between human language experts and language learners works. For this purpose, we created a corpus from instant messenger-based interactions between native speakers of German and advanced learners of German as a foreign language. We used methods from conversation analysis to identify rules of interaction. Examples from our data set are used to illustrate how particular requirements for the agent can be fulfilled. Finally, we outline how the identified patterns of interaction can be used for the design of an Artificial Conversational Companion.",

The pedagogical agent proposed here has the instructional role of a tutor collaborator that participates in the chat discussion following mediation strategies grounded on sociocultural theory to assist the collective writing. Furthermore, we propose a pedagogical agent model that uses text mining techniques to identify when students deviate from the main topics that should be addressed in their discussions in a real time chat. Another important function enabled by the use of the text mining tool involves the assessment of the discussion relevance in relation to the base text, which supports the pedagogical agent decision towards a more adequate intervention. The conception of using text mining to guide the pedagogical agent in the mediation of the students' discussions has been based on previous research that has already shown how this particular mining tool could support educators' work in the evaluation of essays and of students' contributions in discussion forums. Preliminary results of this study are also presented showing the agent's potential to foster students' online conversations.",

Our analysis is organized as a series of linguistic case studies in order to provide a detailed account of interactional and linguistic variation, with specific focus on orthography, interrogative structures, and the use of second-person address pronouns and the negative particle ne. The data demonstrate that the chatbot's discourse is a combination of forms and structures typically associated with informal and formal discourse. Although this lack of register-related consistency and homogeneity never emerged as an expressed concern of the participants, it is clear that the discourse of this particular chatbot represents a less-than-ideal communicative model for learners. As a peer/tool for language learners, the chatbot may offer some (or even a great deal of) potential; however, at present, post-interaction tasks based on transcripts appear to hold the most promise for language awareness and development.",

In the first case study, the obtainable conversation is inspired by the exercises that typically are in a foreign language text book: the chatbot can corrects learners in real time whenever the learner produces incorrect sentences.

		"abstract": "Foreign Language Learning (FLL) students commonly have few opportunities to use their target language. Teachers in FLL situations do their best to create opportunities during classes through pair or group work, but a variety of factors ranging from a lack of time to shyness or limited opportunity for quality feedback hamper this. This paper discusses online chatbots' potential role in fulfilling this need. Chatbots could provide a means of language practice for students anytime and virtually anywhere.\n211 students used two well-known bots in class and their feedback was recorded with a brief written survey. Most students enjoyed using the chatbots. They also generally felt more comfortable conversing with the bots than a student partner or teacher. This is a budding technology that has up to now been designed primarily for native speakers of English. In their present state chatbots are generally only useful for advanced and/or very keen language students. However, means exist now for language teachers to get involved and bring this technology into the FLL classroom as a permanent tool for language practice.",

		"abstract": "This paper investigates the linguistic worth of current ‘chatbot’ programs – software programs which attempt to hold a conversation, or interact, in English – as a precursor to their potential as an ESL (English as a second language) learning resource. After some initial background to the development of chatbots, and a discussion of the Loebner Prize Contest for the most ‘human’ chatbot (the ‘Turing Test’), the paper describes an in-depth study evaluating the linguistic accuracy of a number of chatbots available online. Since the ultimate purpose of the current study concerns chatbots' potential with ESL learners, the analysis of language embraces not only an examination of features of language from a native-speaker's perspective (the focus of the Turing Test), but also aspects of language from a second-language-user's perspective. Analyses indicate that while the winner of the 2005 Loebner Prize is the most able chatbot linguistically, it may not necessarily be the chatbot most suited to ESL learners. The paper concludes that while substantial progress has been made in terms of chatbots' language-handling, a robust ESL ‘conversation practice machine’ (Atwell, 1999) is still some way off being a reality.",

An experiment has been made using this system to work as a chat partner with the users learning the foreign languages. The dialogs have been collected. Statistical results about the dialogs are shown and analyzed. Findings indicate that the dialogs between the human and the computer are mostly short, but also indicate that many participants in this experiment are interested in the system. The reasons are: it is accessible anywhere at any time on contrary to that it is not easy to find a human chatting partner speaking this language as the mother language, and the learners are more confident confronting with a robot or a computer program which is obviously less intelligent as the human themselves.",

For this purpose, use is made of a Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) system that employs Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology to allow spoken interaction and to create an experimental environment that guarantees as much control over the language learning setting as possible. The focus of the present paper is on the resources that are being produced in FASOP. In line with the theme of this conference, we present the different types of resources developed within this project and the way in which these could be used to pursue innovative research in second language acquisition and to develop and improve ASR-based language learning applications.",

		"abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR) have been employed in several foreign language education applications to increase the availability of experiential learning methods akin to international immersion programs. However, research in multi-modal spoken dialogue in L2 combined with immersive technologies and collaborative learning is thin, limiting students’ experiences to solo interactions focused mostly on vocabulary and grammar in such settings. We intend to fill this gap as we present the Cognitive Immersive Language Learning Environment (CILLE). The AI in CILLE can hear, see, and understand its users and can engage with them in non-dyadic multimodal conversations. The XR offers students a feeling of being somewhere else without the use of intrusive devices and supports multi-party, multi-modal interactions. Together, AI and XR create naturalistic conversational interactions targeted towards comprehensive foreign language acquisition. We evaluate CILLE as a Chinese-as-a-foreign-language (CFL) education tool through a seven-week, mixed-methods study with university students (N = 10). Results display statistical significance and retained improvement in CFL vocabulary, comprehension, and conversation skills. Coupled with an analysis of student feedback and researcher observations, we show how CILLE is designed and experienced by students to learn CFL.",
